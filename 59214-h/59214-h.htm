<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>There are at least four different ways of writing a
book on dreams. There is, for instance, the <em>literary</em>
method. In this way one goes to books or to the
memories of other people for one's material, and so
collects a great number of more or less wonderful
stories. I have rejected this method, for it is entirely
untrustworthy. Dreams are elusive at the best; only
a very careful observer can set down a dream faithfully,
even directly after it has occurred, and no one can
safely entrust a dream to memory.</p>

<p>There is, again, what I may call the <em>clinical</em> method
of studying dreams by the personal observation and
collection of facts, with summation and analysis of the
results. On a large scale, with the aid of the <em>questionnaire</em>,
this method has been especially carried on in the United
States, notably at Clark University under the inspiration
of Dr. Stanley Hall. A strict and scientific
adherence to the clinical method of studying dreams
has resulted in Professor Sante de Sanctis's book <em>I Sogni</em>
(first edition 1899), which is, on the whole, the best
book on dreams published in recent years.</p>

<p>Then there is the <em>experimental</em> method, which, not
content with mere objective study of the phenomena,
endeavours to interfere with them and to find out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
results of interference. This method may be combined
with other methods of studying dreams. In its pure
form it has in recent years been especially practised by
the late Mourly Vold. Its results are not without
interest, but they do not cover a large part of the field,
and they are not altogether reliable. Dreaming activity
is so fluid and suggestible&mdash;and this is notably so when
experimenter and subject are the same person&mdash;that
interference with the phenomena deforms them, and we
cannot be sure that by experiment we have really
learned much about the life of dreams.</p>

<p>There is, finally, the <em>introspective</em> method. This may
be said to be the earliest of the more scientific methods
of studying dreams. Maine de Biran was here a
pioneer, and Maury, in his famous book, <cite>Le Sommeil et
les R&ecirc;ves</cite> (1861), which inaugurated the modern study
of dreams, adopted a mainly introspective method,
though he was not always quite successful in avoiding
the fallacies of that method. It is in France that this
method has been most frequently and most successfully
cultivated.</p>

<p>Professor Sigmund Freud's <cite>Die Traumdeutung</cite> (first
edition, 1900), may be said to belong to the introspective
class, though to a special division which Freud himself
terms psycho-analytic. This is undoubtedly the most
original, the most daring, the most challenging of recent
books on dreams, and is now the text-book of a whole
school of investigators. It is not a book to be neglected,
for it is written by one of the profoundest of living investigators
into the obscure depths of the human soul.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
Even if one rejects Freud's methods as unsatisfactory
and his facts as unproved, the work of one so bold and
so sincere cannot fail to be helpful and stimulating in
the highest degree. If it is not the truth it will at
least help us to reach the truth.</p>

<p>The little book now presented to the reader belongs
mainly to the introspective group of dream studies,
though not to the psycho-analytic variety. It is based
on data which have accumulated beneath my hands
during more than twenty years, and some of the ideas
developed in it were put forward in a paper 'On
Dreaming of the Dead,' <cite>Psychological Review</cite>, Sept.
1895; in 'A Note on Hypnagogic Paramnesia,' <cite>Mind</cite>,
No. 22, 1896; and in 'The Stuff that Dreams are made
of,' <cite>Popular Science Monthly</cite>, April 1899. The book
is not the outcome of experiment or of any deliberate
concentration of thought on dreaming. I have simply
noted down dream experiences,&mdash;most often in myself,
less often in immediate friends,&mdash;directly they
have occurred, usually on awakening in the morning.
The few unimportant exceptions to the rule are duly
noted. By maintaining this rule I have been able to
satisfy myself that everything I have set down is
reasonably accurate. Such a method certainly tends
towards the exclusion of peculiar and exceptional
dreams. This I do not greatly regret. I am chiefly
interested in the problems of normal dreaming; they
are sufficiently puzzling and mysterious and they
properly present themselves for explanation first. I do
not wish it to be understood that I question the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
existence of telepathic and other abnormal dream
experiences. That is not the case. But it so happens
that under the conditions I have laid down I have not
met with any dreams that clearly and decisively belong
to this abnormal class. Such few possible examples as
have come under my immediate observation (in no
case as personal experiences) are slight, and, moreover,
sometimes of too intimate a character for full
exposition.</p>

<p>Thus my contribution to the psychology of dreaming
is simple and unpretentious; it deals only with the
fundamental elements of the subject. I do not make
this statement entirely in a spirit of humility. It
seems to me that in the past the literature of dreaming
has often been overweighted by bad observation and
reckless theory. By learning to observe and to understand
the ordinary nightly experience of dream life we
shall best be laying the foundation of future superstructures.
For, rightly understood, dreams may
furnish us with clues to the whole of life.</p>

<p>W<span class="smcapa">HEN</span> we fall asleep we enter a dim and ancient house
of shadow, unillumined by any direct ray from the
outer world of waking life. We are borne about through
its chambers, without conscious volition of our own;
we fall down its mouldy and rotten staircases, we are
haunted by strange sounds and odours from its mysterious
recesses; we move among phantoms we cannot
consciously control. As we emerge into the world of
daily life again, for an instant the sunlight seems to
flash into the obscure house before the door closes
behind us; we catch one vivid glimpse of the chambers
we have been wandering in, and a few more or less
fragmentary memories come back to us of the life we
have led there. But they soon fade away in the light
of common day, and if a few hours later we seek to recall
the strange experiences we have passed through, it
usually happens that the visions of the night have
already dissolved in memory into a few shreds of mist
we can no longer reconstruct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>For most of us our whole knowledge ends here. Our
dreams are real enough while they last, but the interests
of waking life absorb us so entirely that we rarely
have leisure, and still less inclination, to subject our
sleeping adventures, trivial and absurd as they must
usually seem, to the careful tests which waking intelligence
is accustomed to subject more obviously
important matters to. The world of dreams and the
mysterious light which prevails there<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> are abandoned
entirely to our sleeping activities.</p>

<p>This leading characteristic of dream life&mdash;the fact
that it takes place in another and more shadowy world
and in a different kind of consciousness<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>&mdash;has led
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
to the criticism of the study of dreams from the
scientific side. We cannot really study our dreams,
these objectors say, because we&mdash;that is to say, our
waking consciousness&mdash;cannot come sufficiently closely
in contact with them. Dreams, it is argued, are inevitably
transformed in our hands; what we are studying
is not our dreams, but only our waking, and probably
altogether false, impressions of our dreams. There
is a certain element of truth in this objection. It is
very difficult, indeed impossible, to recall exactly, and
in their proper order, even the details of a real adventure
which has only just happened to us. It is,
obviously, incomparably more difficult to recall an
experience which took place, under such shadowy conditions,
in a world so remote from the world of waking
life. There is, further, the very definite difficulty
that we only catch our dreams for a moment by the
light, as it were, of the open door as we are emerging
from sleep. In other words, our waking consciousness
is for a moment observing and interpreting a process
in another kind of consciousness, or even if we assert
that it is the same consciousness it is still a consciousness
that has been working under quite different conditions
from waking consciousness, and accepting data
which in the waking state it would not accept. For the
student of dreams it must ever be a serious question
how far the facts become inevitably distorted in this
process. Sleeping or waking, it is probable, our consciousness
never embraces the whole of the possible
psychic field within us. There are, when we are dreaming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
as well as when we are awake&mdash;as will become
clearer in the sequel&mdash;subconscious, or imperfectly
conscious, states just below our consciousness, and
exerting an influence upon it.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Our latent psychic
possessions, among which dreams move, would seem to
be by no means always at the same depth; the specific
gravity of consciousness, as it were, varies, and these
latent elements rise or fall, becoming nearer to the
conscious surface or falling further away from it. But
the greatest change must take place when the waking
surface is reached and the outer world breaks on sleeping
consciousness. In that change there is doubtless
a process of necessary and automatic transformation
and interpretation. We may picture it, perhaps, as
somewhat the same process as when a person skilled
in both languages takes up a foreign book and reads it
out in his own tongue. With practice the reader may
become unconscious that he is transforming everything,
that the words he utters are different from the words
he sees, and that he even transposes their order, sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
putting in the middle of a sentence the verb he
sees at the end.</p>

<p>Yet even if we admit that the passage from sleeping
to waking consciousness involves a change as complete
as this&mdash;and it is probable, as we shall see, that some such
change sometimes takes place&mdash;for a faithful interpreter
the sense still remains the same. It is impossible to
believe that the witness of waking consciousness to the
nature of the visions it has caught at the threshold
between sleeping and waking life is false, and the most
convincing evidence of this is the utter unlikeness of
these visions to the data of ordinary waking life.</p>

<p>But even this conclusion has been subjected to severe
criticism which we have to face before we proceed
further. Foucault, an acute investigator of dream
psychology&mdash;carrying to its extreme point a position
more partially and tentatively stated by Delbœuf and
Tannery&mdash;has denied that our dreams, as they finally
present themselves to waking consciousness, at all
correspond to the psychic process in sleep upon which
they are founded, and he especially insists that the
logical connections are superadded.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> He considers that
dreaming is an 'observation of memory' made under
such conditions that 'it would be very imprudent to
regard the remembrance of the dream as reproducing
faithfully the mental state of sleep.' During sleep,
he believes, our dream ideas proceed, concurrently, it
may be, but separately and independently; at the
moment when awakening begins, the mind, as an act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
of immediate memory, grasps the plurality of separate
pictures and applies itself spontaneously to the task of
organising them according to the rules of logic and the
laws of the real world, making a drama of them as like
as possible to the dramas of waking life.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> He agrees
with Goblot that 'the dream we remember is a waking
thought,' and with Tannery that 'we do not remember
our dreams, but only the reconstructions of them we
effected at the moment of waking.' It is after awakening,
Foucault concludes, that the dream develops, and
its final shape depends on the period at which it is
noted down; 'the evolution of the dream after awakening
is a logical evolution, dominated and directed by
the instinctive need to give a reasonable appearance
to the <em>ensemble</em> of images and sensations present to the
mind, and to assimilate the representation of the dream
to the system of representations which constitutes our
knowledge of the real world.'<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>In arguing his thesis, Foucault makes much of the
modifications which can be proved to take place if any
one is asked to repeat a dream at intervals of months.
Under the influence of time and repetition a dream
becomes more coherent and more conformed to reality.
In illustration Foucault presents two versions of an
insignificant dream in which a lady imagines that she
is out with her husband for a drive, and in the course
of it experiences a natural need which she seeks an
opportunity to satisfy; the details of the first version
were highly improbable; some months later they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
become much more like what might have occurred in
real life. Such a process, Foucault thinks, is taking
place from the first in the making of dreams as we
know them awake.</p>

<p>There are, undoubtedly, facts which may seem to
support Foucault's argument that the logic of the dream,
as we know it, is not in the original dream, but is introduced
afterwards. Thus I once dreamed in the morning
that I asked my wife if she had been into a certain
room, and that she replied, 'Can't get in.' I immediately
awoke and realised that my wife had actually
spoken these words, not to me, but to an approaching
servant, in anticipation of a message about entering
a neighbouring room of which the door was locked.
It is thus evident that although it seemed to me in my
dream that the question came first and the answer
followed in the ordinary course, in reality the answer
came first. The question was a theory, supplied
automatically by sleeping intelligence and prefixed
to the answer, in which order they both appeared to
sleeping consciousness, that is to say, in the only way
in which sleeping consciousness can ever be known, as
translated into waking consciousness.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that such a dream as I have
recorded&mdash;in which an actual sensory experience is
introduced, untransformed, as a foreign body into sleeping
consciousness&mdash;is not a typical dream. Dreams
are, however, without doubt of various kinds, and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
may well admit that there is a class of dreams formed
in this way. That supposition will, indeed, be helpful
in explaining several dreams I shall have to record. The
process is much the same as when a nervous person
receives a telegram, and at once assumes that some
dreaded accident has occurred, and that the telegram
is the announcement of it. The craving for reasons
is instinctive, and the dreamer's sense of logic even
dominates his sense of time.</p>

<p>But Foucault's argument is that waking consciousness
effects this logical construction of the dream.
Here his position is weak and incapable of proof. It is,
indeed, contrary to all the tests we are able to apply to
it. If it is the object of the logic of our dreams to make
them conformable to our waking experience, that end,
we must admit, is in most cases very far from being
attained. In their original form, as Foucault views the
matter, our dreams are simple dissociated images. In
that shape they would present nothing whatever to
shock the consciousness of waking life. The logic,
hypothetically introduced solely to make them conformable
to real life, is frequently a preposterous logic
such as the consciousness of waking life could not
accept or even conceive. This fact alone serves to
throw serious doubt upon the theory that it is waking
consciousness which impresses its logic upon our dreams.</p>

<p>Nor, again, is there any analogy, and still less identity,
between the process whereby we grasp a dream when
we awake, and the process whereby the memory of a
dream is transformed during months of waking life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
The latter is part of a general process affecting all our
memories in greater or less degree. I visit, for instance,
a foreign cathedral, and take careful note of the
character and arrangement of buttresses and piers;
a few months later, if I have failed to set the facts down,
my memory of them will become uncertain, confused,
and incorrect. But I need not, therefore, lose faith
in the tolerable exactitude of my original impressions.
In the same way, we cannot argue that the shifting
memory of a dream during a long period of time throws
the slightest doubt on the accuracy of our original
impression of it. We never catch a dream in course
of formation. As it presents itself to consciousness on
awakening there may be doubtful points and there may
be missing links, but the dream is, once for all, completed,
and if there are doubtful points or missing
links we recognise them as such. We make no attempt
to supply a logic that is not there, and we never see any
such process going on involuntarily. I should, indeed,
myself be inclined to say that there is always a kind
of gap between sleeping consciousness and waking
consciousness; the change from the one to the other
kind of consciousness seems to be effected by a slight
shock, and the perception of the already completed
dream is the first effort of waking consciousness. The
existence of such a shock is indicated by the fact that,
even at the first moment of waking consciousness, we
never realise that a moment ago we were asleep. As
soon as we realise that we are awake it seems to us that
we have already been awake for an uncertain but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
distinct period of time; some people, indeed, especially
old people, on awaking, feel this so strongly that they
deny they have been asleep. It once happened to me
to be in the neighbourhood of a dynamite factory at
the moment when a very disastrous explosion occurred;
at the time my back was to the factory, and I am quite
unable to say how long an interval occurred between
the shock of the explosion and my own action in turning
round to observe the straight shaft of smoke and solid
material high in the air; there was a gap in consciousness,
an interval of unknown and seemingly considerable
length, caused by the deafening shock of the
explosion, although it is probable that my action in
turning round was almost or quite instantaneous. It
seems to me that the transition from sleeping consciousness
to waking consciousness occurs in a similar
manner on a smaller scale.</p>

<p>Although the view of Foucault that the dream is
logically organised after sleep has ended seems, when we
examine the evidence in its favour, to be unacceptable,
we may still admit that, in some cases at all events,
the dream only assumes final shape at the moment
when sleeping consciousness is breaking up, that the
dream, as we know it, is a final synthetic attempt of
sleeping consciousness as it dissolves on the approach
of waking consciousness. Sleeping consciousness, we
may even imagine as saying to itself in effect:
'Here comes our master, Waking Consciousness, who
attaches such mighty importance to reason and logic
and so forth. Quick! gather things up, put them in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
order&mdash;any order will do&mdash;before he enters to take
possession.' That is to say, in other words, that as
sleeping consciousness comes nearer to the threshold
of waking consciousness it is possible that the need for
the same kind of causation or sequence which is manifested
in waking consciousness may begin to make
itself felt even to sleeping consciousness. Even this
assumption seems, however, as regards most dreams,
to be extravagant. In any case, and at whatever stage
the dream is finally constituted, we are not entitled,
it seems to me, to believe that any stage of its constitution
falls outside the frontiers of sleep. It is
satisfactory to be able to feel justified in reaching this
conclusion. For if dreams were chiefly or mainly
the product of waking consciousness they would certainly
lose a considerable part of their significance and
interest.</p>

<p>Even, however, when we have reached this conclusion
the path of the student is still far from easy. The
undoubted fact that in any case the difficulties of observing
and recording dreams are very great cannot
fail to make us extremely careful. Although the dreams
of some persons, who may be regarded as themselves
of vivid and dramatic temperament, seem to be habitually
vivid and dramatic to an extent which, in my own
case, is extremely rare, one is usually justified in feeling
a certain amount of suspicion in regard to dream-narratives
which are at every point clear, coherent,
connected, and intelligible. Dreams, as I know them
on awaking from sleep, occasionally present episodes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
to which these epithets may be applied, but on the
whole they are full of obscurities, of uncertainties, of
inexplicable lacunae. The memory of dream events
is lost so rapidly that one is constantly obliged to leave
the exact nature of a detail in doubt. One seems to be
recalling a landscape seen by a lightning flash. It is
for this reason that I have made it a rule only to admit
dreams which are noted very shortly, and if possible
immediately, after the moment of awakening. It is
further of importance in recording one's dreams, to note
the emotional attitude experienced during the dream
as well as any physical sensations felt on awakening.
The attitude of dream consciousness towards dream
visions usually varies from that of waking consciousness,
although the normal extent of the difference is a disputable
point. When I read dream narratives of landscapes
which, as described, appear at every point as
beautiful and impressive to waking consciousness as
they appeared to dreaming consciousness, I usually
suspect that, granting the good faith and accuracy of
the narrator, we are really concerned, not with dreams
in the proper sense, but with visions experienced under
more abnormal conditions, and especially with drug
visions. In the present inquiry I am only concerned
to ascertain the most elementary and fundamental
laws of the dream world, as they occur in fairly ordinary
and normal persons, and therefore it becomes necessary
to be very strict as to the conditions under which
they were recorded. It is the most ordinary dreams
that are most likely to reveal the ordinary laws of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
dream life, but for this end it is necessary that they
should be recorded with the greatest accuracy attainable.</p>

<p>I am myself neither a constant nor, usually, a very
vivid dreamer, and in these respects I am probably
a fairly ordinary and normal person; the personal
material which I have accumulated, though it spreads
over twenty years, is not notably copious. Nor have I
ever directed my attention in any systematic and concentrated
manner to my dream life. To do so would be,
I believe, to distort the phenomena. I have merely
recorded any significant phenomena as they occurred.</p>

<p>To remark that one is not a constant dreamer is not
to assert that dreaming is rare, but merely that one's
recollection of it is rare. Though we may only catch
a glimpse of our latest vision of the night as we leave
the house of sleep, it may well be that there were
many earlier adventures of the night which are beyond
the reach of waking consciousness. Sometimes, it is
curious to note, we become vaguely conscious, during
the day, for the first time, of a dream we have had
during the night. Many psychologists, as well as
metaphysicians&mdash;fearful to admit that the activity of
the soul could ever cease&mdash;believe that we dream
during the whole period of sleep; this has of recent years
been the opinion of Vaschide, Foucault, N&auml;cke, and
Sir Arthur Mitchell, as it formerly was of Sir Benjamin
Brodie, Sir Henry Holland, and Schaaffhausen. In
earlier days Hippocrates, Descartes, Leibnitz, and
Cabanis seem to have been of the same opinion. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the other hand, Locke, Macnish, and Carpenter held
that deep sleep is dreamless; this is also the opinion
of Wundt, Beaunis, Str&uuml;mpell, Weygandt, Hammond,
and Jastrow. Moreover, there are some people, like
Lessing, who, so far as they know, never dream at all.
My own personal experience scarcely inclines me to
accept without qualification the belief that we are
always dreaming during sleep. I find that my remembered
dreams tend to be correlated with some
slight mental or physical disturbance, and therefore
it seems to me probable that, if dreams are continuous
during sleep, they must, during completely undisturbed
sleep, be of an extremely faint and shadowy character.
To return to a metaphor I have before used, we may
say that sleeping consciousness in its descent from the
surface of the waking life may fall to a point at which
its specific gravity being practically the same as that
of its environment, a state approaching complete
repose is attained.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> It cannot of course be said that
the failure to remember dreams is any argument against
their occurrence. It is well known that when the
psychic activity of sleep assumes a definitely motor
shape, as in talking in sleep and in somnambulism, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
is very rare for any recollection to remain on awakening,
though we cannot doubt that psychic activity has been
present. In the same way the dream that we remember
when awakened from sound sleep by another person
is by no means always due to that awakening. This
is shown by the fact that if we were turning round
or making other movements just before being thus
awakened, the dream we remember&mdash;in one such case
a dream of making one's way with difficulty between
a sofa and a chair&mdash;may have no relation to the circumstance
of the awakening, but clearly be suggested
by the movements made during sleep, though these
movements themselves remain unknown to waking
consciousness. The movements of dogs during sound
sleep&mdash;the rhythmical lifting of the paws, the wagging
of the tail&mdash;point in the same direction.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>The fact that failure of memory by no means proves
the absence of dreaming may be illustrated, not only
by the forgetfulness of what takes place during hypnotic
sleep, but by what we sometimes witness during partial
anaesthesia maintained by drugs. This was well shown
in a case I was once concerned with, where it was
necessary to administer chloroform (preceded by the
alcohol-chloroform-ether mixture) for a prolonged
period during a difficult first confinement. The drug<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
was not given to the point of causing complete abolition
of mental activity, and the patient talked, and occasionally
sang, throughout, referring to various events in
her life, from childhood onwards. The sensation and
the expression of pain were not altogether abolished,
for slight cries and remarks about the discomfort and
constraint imposed upon her were sometimes mingled
in the same sentence with quite irrelevant remarks
concerning, for instance, trivial details of housekeeping.
Confusions of incompatible ideas also took place, as
during ordinary dreaming. 'Where is the three-cornered
nurse,' she thus asked, 'who does not mind
what she does?' There was also the abnormal suggestibility
of dream consciousness. The questions of
bystanders were answered but always with a tendency
to agree with everything that was said, this tendency
even displaying itself with a certain ingenuity as when
in reply to the playful random query: 'Were you
drunk or sleeping last night?' she answered, with some
hesitation: 'A little of both, I think.' To the casual
observer, it might seem that there was a state of full
consciousness on the basis of which a partial delirium
had established itself. Yet on recovery from the drug
there was no recollection of anything whatever that
had taken place during its administration, and no sense
of the lapse of time.</p>

<p>Fantastic and marvellous as our dreams may sometimes
be, they are in practically all cases made up of
very simple elements. It is desirable that we should
at the outset have a provisional notion as to the sources<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
of these simple elements. Most writers on dreams
hold that there are two great sources from which these
elements are drawn: the vast reservoir of memories
and the actual physical sensations experienced at the
moment of dreaming, and interpreted by sleeping
consciousness. Various names have been given to
these two groups, the recognition of which is at least
as old as Aristotle.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Thus Sully calls them central
and peripheral, Tissi&eacute;, psychic and sensorial, Foucault,
imaginative and perceptive. Fairly convenient names
are those adopted by Miss Calkins, who calls the first
group representative, the second group presentative,
meaning by representative 'connected through the fact
of association with the waking life of the past,' and by
presentative 'connected through sense excitation with
the immediate present.'<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The representative group falls into two subdivisions,
according as the memories are of old or of recent
date; these subdivisions are often quite distinct, recent
dream memories belonging&mdash;probably with most people&mdash;to
the previous day, while old dream memories are
usually drawn from the experience of many years past,
and frequently from early life. In the same way
presentative impressions fall into two subdivisions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
according as they refer to external stimuli present to
the senses, or to internal disturbances within the organism.
It is scarcely necessary to observe that any or
all of these four sub-groups, into which the whole of
our dream life may be analysed, may become woven
together in the same dream.</p>

<p>I have called the classification 'provisional' because,
though it is convenient to adopt it for the sake of orderly
arrangement, when we come to consider the matter it
will be found that the material of dreams is in reality
all of the same order, and purely psychic, though it
may be differentiated in accordance with the character
of the stimulus which evokes the psychic material of
which it is made. Strictly speaking, the source of the
dream as a dream can only be central, and a truly
presentative dream is impossible. If our senses receive
an impression, external or internal, and we recognise
and accept that impression for what we should
recognise and accept it when awake, then we cannot
be said to be dreaming. The internal and external
stimuli which act upon sleeping consciousness are not
a part of that consciousness, nor in any real sense its
source or its cause. The ray of sunlight that falls on
the dreamer, the falling off of his bedclothes, the indigestible
supper he ate last night&mdash;these things can no
more 'account' for his dream than the postman's
knock can account for the contents of the letter he
delivers. Whatever the stimuli from the physical
world that may knock at the door of dreaming consciousness,
that consciousness is apart from them, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
stimuli can only reach it by undergoing transformation.
They must put off the character which they wear as
phenomena of the waking world; they must put on
the character of phenomena of another world, the world
of dreams.</p>

<p>P<span class="smcapa">ERHAPS</span> the most elementary fact about dream vision
is the perpetual and unceasing change which it is undergoing
at every moment. Sight is for most of us
the chief sensory activity of sleeping as it is of waking
life; the commonest kind of dream is mainly a picture,
but it is always a living and moving picture, however
inanimate the objects which appear in vision before us
would be in real life. No man ever gazed at a dream
picture which was at rest to his sleeping eye as are the
pictures we gaze at with our waking eyes. So far as
my own experience is concerned, I have rarely in sleep
seen a sentence, a word, a letter written on a sheet of
dream-paper which was not changing beneath the eye
of sleep. I dream, for instance, that I wish to stamp
a letter, and look in my pocket-book for a penny stamp;
I am able to find stamps of other values, I am able to
find penny stamps that are torn or defaced or of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
antiquated type disused thirty years ago; all sorts
of stamps, as well as little pictures resembling stamps,
develop and multiply beneath my gaze; the stamp I
seek remains unfound, probably because it had appeared
at the beginning of the series and suggested all the rest.
That is indicated by another dream (experienced, it
may be noted, during the early stage of a cold in the
head): I have to catch a train; I see my hat hanging
on a peg among other hats, and I move towards it;
but as I do so it has vanished; and I wander among
rows of hats, of all shapes and sizes, but not one of them
mine. Sleeping consciousness is a stream in which we
never bathe twice, for it is renewed every second. It
is this as much as any characteristic of the visual
dream&mdash;for the mainly auditory or motor dream often
presents less difficulty in this respect&mdash;which makes it
so difficult to recall and reproduce. We are, as it were,
gazing at a constantly revolving kaleidoscope in which
every slightest turn produces a new pattern, somewhat
resembling that which immediately preceded it&mdash;so
that, if the kaleidoscope were conscious we should say
that each picture had been suggested by the preceding
pattern&mdash;but yet definitely novel.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Delbœuf has denied that this process ever involves
any real metamorphosis of images; he regarded it as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
an illusion due to rapid succession of distinct images
which are afterwards combined in memory. That
view is not, however, tenable; apart from the fact
that it makes the illegitimate assumption that our
recollection of a dream is entirely unreliable, it must be
remembered that (as Giessler has pointed out) the
shock of emotional horror or surprise that frequently
accompanies such dreams suffices to prove the reality
of the metamorphosis. Thus I once, as a youth, had
a vivid dream of an albatross that became transformed
into a woman, the beautiful eyes of the albatross taking
on a womanly expression, but the bird's beak only
being imperfectly changed into a nose as the bird-woman
murmured, 'Do you love me?' In this case
the vivid surprise of the dream was precisely associated
with the simultaneous existence of the two sets of
characters.</p>

<p>It is not, however, necessary that there should be any
metamorphosis of dream images, nor even that the
procession of dream imagery should be continuous.
And whether or not there is metamorphosis of images,
whether the imagery is continuous or discontinuous,
it seems to me that we must admit the possibility of
its spontaneous character. That is, indeed, a debated,
and, it may be admitted, a debateable point. Thus
Foucault<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> accounts for the multiplication of almost
similar images sometimes witnessed in dreams as due
to <em>desire;</em> we see a number of things because we desire
to possess a number of these things, and he explains a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
dream of Delbœuf's, of a procession of lizards, as due
to the fact that Delbœuf was a collector of lizards, in
the same way as he would explain the dreams of thirsty
people who imagine they are drinking repeated glasses
of water or wine. I am quite unable to accept this
explanation. The shifting and multiplication of dream
imagery, as in the procession of lizards, is a fundamental
and elementary character of spontaneous mental imagery,
and is constant in some drug visions, notably
those occasioned by mescal.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The repetition of imaginary
drinks in the dreams of a thirsty man belongs to
another more special class in explanation of which
desire may be more properly invoked; it is merely the
expression of the fact that after the imaginary drink
the dreamer remains thirsty, and the suggested image
is therefore repeated.</p>

<p>That in some cases there is what we may call a deliberate
subconscious selection in the imagery presented
to consciousness in dreams, there can be no
doubt. But mental imagery is deeper and more
elemental than any of the higher psychic functions
even when exerted subconsciously. Just as the immense
procession of continuous and totally unfamiliar imagery
which is evoked by the action of mescal on the visual
centres has no more connection with the subject's
volition or desires than the procession of the starry
skies, so likewise, we seem bound to admit, it may be
in the case of a succession of separate images in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
dreams. It is nearly always possible to find a link of
connection between any two images chosen at random,
and the link is often a real subconscious link, but not
necessarily so. Discontinuous images may arise, it
seems probable, from a psychic basis deeper than choice,
their appearance being determined by their own dynamic
condition at the moment. We must, as Baron Mourre<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
not quite happily puts it, take into account 'the physiological
state of ideas.' If we hold to the belief that
dreaming is based on a fundamental and elementary
tendency to the formation of continuous or discontinuous
images, which may or may not be controlled by
psychic emotions or impulses, we shall be delivered
from many hazardous speculations.</p>

<p>When we thus start with the recognition of a more or
less spontaneous procession of images as the elemental
stuff of dreams, one of the first problems we encounter
is the relation of attention to that imagery. What is
the degree and the nature of the attention we exert in
dreams?</p>

<p>'Sleep from the psychological point of view,' says
Foucault, 'is a state of profound distraction or total
inattention.' And Mourre shows by dreams of his own
that any exercise of will in dreaming leads to awakening,
and that the deeper the sleep the more absent is volition
from dreams. Hence the involuntary wavering and
perpetually mere meaningless change of dream imagery.
Such concentration as is possible during sleep usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
reveals a shifting, oscillating, uncertain movement of
the vision before us. We are, as it were, reading a
sign-post in the dusk, or making guesses at the names
of the stations as our express train flashes by the painted
letters. It is this factor in dreams which causes them
so often to baffle our analysis. There is thus a failure
of sleeping attention to fix definitely the final result&mdash;a
failure which itself may evidently serve to carry on
the dream process by suggesting new images and combinations.
It can scarcely be said, however, that the
question of attention in dreams is thus settled. It
would be inconceivable that the terrible occurrences
that may overtake us in dreams and the emotional
turmoil aroused should be accompanied by 'total inattention
and distraction.' Nor can it be said that that
supposition agrees with the vivid memory which our
dreams sometimes leave. We can probably account
for the phenomena much more satisfactorily by adopting
Ribot's useful distinction between voluntary attention
and spontaneous attention.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Voluntary or artificial
attention is a product of education and training. It is
directed by extrinsic force, is the result of deliberation,
and is accompanied by some feeling of effort.
It always acts on the muscles and by the muscles;
without muscular tension there can be no voluntary
attention. Spontaneous or natural attention, on the
other hand, is that more fundamental kind of attention
which exists anteriorly to any education or training,
and is the only kind of attention which animals and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
young children are capable of. It may be weak or
strong, but always and everywhere it is based on
emotional states; every creature moved by pleasure
and pain is capable of spontaneous attention under the
influence of those stimuli. These two kinds of attention
are at the opposite poles from each other, and are
incompatible with each other. There can be no doubt
that, as Ribot himself pointed out, it is voluntary
attention that is defective (though it may not always
be entirely absent) in dreams;<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> the muscular weakness
and inco-ordination of sleep involve this lack of attention
which is indeed an essential condition of the restoration
and repose of sleep. But all the characters of
spontaneous attention are present. The attention we
exercise in dreams is mainly of this fundamental, automatic,
involuntary character, conditioned by the emotions
we experience, and for the most part escaping all
the efforts of our voluntary attention. Further, it has
been ably argued by Leroy that a similar state of
involuntary automatic attention, with concomitant
diminution or disturbance of voluntary attention, is a
necessary condition for the appearance of the visual
and auditory hallucinations abnormally experienced
in the waking state.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>There is, then, at the basis of dreaming a seemingly
spontaneous procession of dream imagery which is
always undergoing transformation into something
different, yet not wholly different, from that which
went before. It seems a mechanical flow of images,
regulated by associations of resemblance, which sleeping
consciousness recognises without either controlling or
introducing foreign elements. This is probably the
most elementary form of dreaming, that which is
nearest to waking consciousness, and that in which
the peripheral and retinal element of dreaming plays
the largest part.</p>

<p>The fundamental character of this spontaneous self-evolving
procession of imagery is indicated by the
significant fact that it tends to take place whenever the
more retinal and peripheral part of the visual apparatus
is affected by the exhaustion of undue stimulation, or
even when the organism generally is disturbed or run
down, as in neurasthenic conditions.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The most
obtrusive and familiar example of visual imagery is
furnished by the procession of perpetually shifting and
changing after-images which continue to evolve for a
considerable time after we have looked at the sun or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
other brilliant object.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Less striking, but more intimately
akin to the imagery of dreams, are the hypnagogic
visions occurring as we fall asleep, especially after a day
during which vision has been unusually stimulated and
fatigued, though they do not seem necessarily dependent
on such fatigue. Most vivid and instructive of all is the
procession of visual imagery evoked by certain drugs.
Of these the most remarkable and potent, as well as the
best for study, is probably mescal, which happens also
to be the only one with which I am myself well acquainted.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
This substance provokes a constant succession
of self-evolving visual imagery which constantly
approaches and constantly eludes the semblance of
real things; in the earlier stages these images closely
resemble those produced by the kaleidoscope, and they
change in a somewhat similar manner. Such spontaneous
evolution of imagery is evidently a fundamental aptitude
of the visual apparatus which many very slightly
abnormal conditions may bring into prominence.</p>

<p>The power of opium is somewhat similar, and, as
DeQuincey long since pointed out, such power is simply
a revival of a faculty usually possessed by children,
although, judging from my own experiences with
mescal, drugs exert it in a far more vivid and potent
degree than that in which it usually occurs in the child.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
The psychologists of childhood have not often investigated
this phenomenon,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> but so far as my own inquiries
go, all or nearly all persons have possessed,
when children, the power of seeing visions in the dark
on the curtain of the closed eyelids, perhaps the representation
of fairy tales they had read, perhaps
merely commonplace processions of individuals or
events, a tendency sometimes appearing for the same
figure to recur again and again. I think it is fairly
certain that the so-called 'lies' of children, told in good
faith, are in part due to the occasional eruption of this
faculty into daylight life. People who deny that they
ever possessed this power have, almost certainly, only
forgotten. I should myself be inclined to deny that I
had ever had any such visionary faculty if it were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
that I can recall one occasion of its presence, at about
the age of seven, when sleeping with a cousin of the
same age; we amused ourselves by burying our heads
in the pillows and watching a connected series of
pictures which we were both alike able to see, each
announcing any change in the picture as soon as it took
place. This fact of community of vision served to
impress on my mind the existence of a faculty of which
otherwise I can recall no trace.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Of these various groups of allied phenomena, that
which more especially concerns us in the investigation
of dreams is the group of phenomena most strictly
called hypnagogic, belonging, that is to say, to the ante-chamber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
of sleep, when the senses are in repose and
waking consciousness is slipping away, or else when,
as we leave the world of dreams, waking consciousness
is flowing back again. This state has been known
from very ancient times. Aristotle referred to it, and
in the dawn of modern scientific thought Hobbes
described allied phenomena.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The strictly psychological
study of hypnagogic visions seems to have begun with
Baillarger.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Then, some years later, Maury, who had
a rich personal experience of such phenomena, devoted
a chapter to the hypnagogic state, and gave it its
recognised name.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Hypnagogic imagery, there can be little doubt, is
not a purely ocular phenomenon, even when it is stimulated
by ocular fatigue. It is a mixed phenomenon,
partly retinal and partly central. That is to say that
the eye supplies entoptic glimmerings, and the brain,
acting on the suggestions thus received, superposes
mental pictures to those glimmerings.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> They are thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
analogous to the pictures we may see in the fire or in
the clouds. It must be added that the other senses
also furnish corresponding rudiments which are filled
in by the central activity; this is notably the case
with faint buzzings and sounds in the ear, and in addition,
muscular twitches and internal visceral sensations,
all these becoming more prominent as the attentive
activity of waking life subsides.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>What is the relation of hypnagogic imagery to dreams?
Johannes M&uuml;ller, the great physiologist, long ago
identified them, as previously had Gruithuisen and
Burdach, while Maury&mdash;who himself possessed, however,
a somewhat abnormal and irritable nervous system&mdash;regarded
hypnotic imagery as furnishing the whole of
the formative element of dreams, as being 'the embryogeny
of dreams'; he frequently found that images
which appeared to him in this way before going to sleep
reappeared in dreams. This is supported by Mourly
Vold, who made experiments on himself, and by fixing
images as he fell asleep dreamed of the same images.
Goblot, however, while regarding hypnagogic imagery
as analogous with dream imagery, denies that it is
identical. Since the hypnagogic state is the porch to
sleep and dreams&mdash;the praedormitium, as Weir Mitchell
terms it&mdash;we can scarcely fail to admit with Maury
that hypnagogic imagery presents us with the germinal
stuff of dreams. If it is not identical with the fully
formed dream, it is still the early stage of dreaming.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
This is certainly the view suggested by my own experience,
even though I have never definitely recognised
a dream as related to a previous hypnagogic
image. It has, however, occasionally happened to me
that as I have begun to lose waking consciousness a
procession of images has drifted before my vision, and
suddenly one of the figures I see has spoken. This
hallucinatory voice occurring before I was fully asleep
has startled me into full waking consciousness, and I
have realised that, while yet in the hypnagogic stage,
I was assisting at the birth of a dream.</p>

<p>There is one point, it may be noted in passing, at
which dreams do not usually correspond with some of
the phenomena with which we may most naturally
compare them. I refer to their presentation of colour.
In the dreams of most people colour is rare. We seem
usually, from this point of view, to remember a dream
as we would remember a photograph, or, if any colour
at all is present, a tinted drawing. Judging from my
own experience, I should say that it is difficult to
decide whether the absence of colour is due to its actual
absence from the dream imagery, or merely to its failure
to make any impression on memory. Some careful
observers have, however, stated that the colour of their
dream imagery is definitely grey. Thus Beaunis states
that his dream imagery is usually <em xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en grisaille</em>, like
an image recalled in the waking state, though occasionally
the colour is vivid, and Dr. Savage says that in his
dreams colour is rarely or never present. 'I see landscapes
of black and white, and flowers assume their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
true form, but not their colours.'<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> This greyness of
dream imagery corresponds to the disappearance of
colour under chloroform anaesthesia. 'So long as the
eyes could be held open voluntarily,' says Elmer Jones,
'vision seemed quite normal, save that the colours of
the spectrum faded out into a grey band.' Even in
the early stage of some insanities also, as Stoddart has
found, some degree of colour-blindness is present.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
Grace Andrews states, indeed, that in nearly half of
her own visual dreams colour sensations were included.
This seems to me exceptional. In my own experience,
the emergence of a single colour, which usually strikes
me as beautiful, is not rare. I see, for instance, a friend
drinking wine copiously from a large goblet, and I
judge by the colour of the wine that it is hock, or I am
impressed by the shimmering grey tone of the poplin
dresses worn by a group of ladies, which seems to
indicate that the tone of the whole picture was not
grey. I am inclined to think that when colour in a
dream becomes more pronounced than this, the dream
is not normal, but is associated with some degree of
cerebral disturbance, and especially the presence of
headache. This would agree with the fact that persons
subject to migraine are liable to visual colour phenomena.
As an example of a vivid colour dream associated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
with headache, I may bring forward the following:
I dreamed that an artist of note, with whom I am
acquainted, was painting my portrait. (The pose of
the portrait was standing, but I was lying down; this,
however, caused me no surprise.) I saw the colours of
the picture with great vividness, and I noted the extreme
rapidity with which the artist painted; thus
the red and black pattern of the necktie he had given
me was suddenly changed to a totally different blue
pattern, and the whole picture then appeared as a
harmony of blues, the rapidity with which the artist
effected these changes impressing me as very remarkable.
In another dream in which I saw a painter
occupied on a picture, a landscape representing sunrise,
memory recalled the effect of light as vivid, but no
definite sense of colour remained. This seems to me
the normal condition of things in the ordinary dreams
of most persons, colour, when it occurs, or when it is
remembered, being for the most part confined to a single
object or a single tint, and often being associated with a
feeling of aesthetic pleasure.</p>

<p>In ordinary dreaming there is usually something
more than a spontaneous procession of related imagery.
There is a more definitely central and psychic element.
There is association, not only by obvious resemblance,
but by contiguity, usually the casual contiguity of
images received during the previous day, which forces
together images related to each other indeed, but by
no means obviously. Dreaming consciousness embodies
and actively co-ordinates definite, and not merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
random, images. The passive and spontaneous flow of
imagery is thus modified in its course.</p>

<p>The image of the magic lantern well illustrates this
character of dream experiences. The movement of the
cinematograph, indeed, scarcely corresponds to that
fusion of heterogeneous images which marks dream
visions. Our dreams are like dissolving views in which
the dissolving process is carried on swiftly or slowly,
but always uninterruptedly, so that at any moment
two (often, indeed, more) incongruous pictures are
presented to consciousness, which strives to make one
whole of them, and sometimes succeeds, and is sometimes
baffled. Or we may say that the problem presented
to dreaming consciousness resembles that experiment
in which psychologists pronounce three wholly
unconnected words and require the subject to combine
them at once in a connected sentence. It is unnecessary
to add that such analogies fail to indicate the
subtle complexity of the apparatus which is at work
in the manufacture of dreams.</p>

<p>By this mechanism of dreaming, isolated impressions,
or else impressions which have a resemblance or a
connection which is not obvious to the waking intelligence,
flow together in dreams to be welded into a
whole. There is produced, in the strictest sense, a
<em>confusion</em>. For instance, a lady, who in the course
of the day has admired a fine baby and bought a
big fish for dinner, dreams with horror and surprise
of finding a fully developed live baby sewed up in a
large cod-fish. Again, a lady who had been cooking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
in the course of the day and in the evening had read
a scientific description of the way birds obtain and
utilise their food, such as fruit and snails, dreams at
night that she has discovered when out walking a kind
of animal-fruit, a damson containing a snail within it,
which she views with delight as admirably adapted for
culinary purposes. Another lady, after carving a
duck at dinner, dreams that she is trying to cut off
a duck's leg, but seems to realise in her dream at the
same time that it is really her husband's neck she is
hacking at.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> In a dream of my own, children's heads
took the form and shape of flowers of various shapes
and hues, though mainly of the composite order (like
chrysanthemums), and their eyes looked out from
between the petals.</p>

<p>It must be added that in a very considerable proportion
of cases the combinations produced in dreams
are far more plausible than in any of the instances just
narrated; the whole dream may thus easily follow as
commonplace and matter-of-fact a course as in real life.
Thus, after going to live in a new neighbourhood, I
dreamed that I entered a shop belonging to a certain
firm, and saw there an employ&eacute; who, in real life, to
my knowledge, had previously left another shop belonging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
to the same firm; an entirely probable combination
was thus effected, and the dream conversation that
followed was equally natural and probable. We do
not go out of our way in dreams to invent absurdities;
we simply accept the data presented to us, dealing with
them as rationally as the intellectual instruments at
our disposal may permit.</p>

<p>The dream constituted by the falling together of
trivial reminiscences is not always, however, as commonplace
and plausible as in the dream just narrated. In
other cases the falling together of equally trivial reminiscences
may constitute a fantastic and imaginative
picture altogether outside waking experience or waking
thought. Thus I dream that it is my duty to watch
beside a great king while he sleeps. He lies on a huge
bed, fully clothed and booted, and with a great crimson
mantle thrown over him. I am permitted to lie on the
edge of the bed outside the mantle, but must on no
account close my eyes, for I must be ready to respond
at once to his call. The elements of such a picture are
obviously so simple and commonplace that it is not
surprising that I could not find that even one of them
had been specially present to waking consciousness.
Yet the picture that at that particular moment they
fell together to compose&mdash;like the broken fragments
of coloured glass in a kaleidoscope&mdash;is altogether
alien alike to my experience and to my imagination.</p>

<p>The source of the common confusion of dream
imagery is to be found in very varying motives. In a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
large proportion of cases, what we witness is merely
the flowing together of impressions which have no
real resemblance, but which happen to have been
received at nearly the same time, and to admit of being
fused; thus, in one case, occupation during the day
partly in the fowl-yard and partly in the garden, led
a lady to the dream project of breeding chickens by
planting fowls' heads. Very frequently, however, there
is a real resemblance in the two objects combined,
although it is not a resemblance which would ever
present itself to waking consciousness. The fowl-yard
will supply another instance of this confusion also. I
went to sleep thinking of a friend who was that night
to stay at a certain hotel I had never seen. I dreamed
that I saw the hotel in question; its fa&ccedil;ade was not
unlike that of a common type of hotel, but the roof was
flat and at no very great height from the ground, so
that I was able to overlook the building and see into all
the windows, an arrangement that struck me as bad.
My ability to overlook the building was not, however,
accompanied by any perception of its diminutiveness.
On awakening I remembered that my wife had received
a chicken incubator the day before, and we had examined
it in the evening. The image of the hotel had fused
with the image of the incubator.</p>

<p>In another dream of the same type I imagined that
I was with a dentist who was about to extract a tooth
from a patient. Before applying the forceps he remarked
to me (at the same time setting fire to a perfumed
cloth at the end of something like a broomstick,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
in order to dissipate the unpleasant odour) that it was
the largest tooth he had ever seen. When extracted I
found that it was indeed enormous, in the shape of a
caldron, with walls an inch thick. Taking from my
pocket a tape measure (such as I carried in waking life),
I found the diameter to be not less than twenty-five
inches; the interior was like roughly-hewn rock, and
there were sea-weeds and lichen-like growths within.
The size of the tooth seemed to me large, but not
extraordinarily so. It is well known that pain in the
teeth, or the dentist's manipulations, cause those organs
to seem of extravagant extent; in dreams this tendency
rules unchecked; thus a friend once dreamed that
mice were playing about in a cavity in her tooth. But
for the dream just quoted, there was no known dental
origin; it arose solely or chiefly from a walk during the
previous afternoon among the rocks of the Cornish
coast at low tide, and the fantastic analogy, which had
not occurred to waking consciousness, suggested itself
during sleep.</p>

<p>In another dream, illustrating the same kind of
confusion of images having a real resemblance unnoticed
in waking life, I seemed to see on a table a small hand-gong
of a common type, struck by a hammer, but on
striking it repeatedly, it produced flashes of light
instead of the sounds normally produced by a gong.
I concluded that the instrument must be out of order
and called some one to attend to it, whereupon we
proceeded to deal with it as though it were a diminutive
battery of the kind used to work electric bells. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
gong was one familiar to me at the time in daily life;
on the previous day I had casually observed that it
was misplaced. In my dream I discovered a resemblance
which actually exists between a gong of the type
in question and the lever-handle for turning on the
electric light, soothing a certain doubt by saying to
myself in my dream that the instrument served both
for the production of sound and of light. This link of
connection led to the association of an electric battery
with the hand-gong, as well as to the attribution to the
gong of light-giving properties.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Such a dream serves as a transition to another very
common kind of confusion of imagery in which two
altogether unlike images are amalgamated through each
happening to have in the mind a link of connection
with some third idea. I dreamed that my wife's dog&mdash;a
dog who, in real life, was constantly getting into
trouble&mdash;had killed a child in the neighbouring town.
On going thither I entered a butcher's shop, and saw
the child lying on a table, mutilated and bleeding.
After a time, however, I learned that it was not a child,
but a pig that had been killed, and what I had previously
taken for a child was now visibly a dead pig. I
felt ashamed of my mistake, and the sympathy I had
experienced now seemed excessive, especially when the
butcher remarked that it was all right as he had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
fattening the pig and meant to kill it soon anyhow.
Then the pig was cut open, though it made daring
attempts to come to life again, during which I awoke.
It is clear how, in this case, the idea of the butcher's
shop served as a bridge from the image of the child to
the image of the pig. Again, after a day in which I
had received a letter from a lady, unknown to me,
living in France, and later on had written out a summary
of a criminal case in which a detective had to go over
to France, I dreamed that some one told me that the
lady I had heard from was a detective in the service
of the French Government, and this explanation, though
it seemed somewhat surprising, fully satisfied me.
Here, it will be seen, the idea of France served as a
bridge, and was utilised by sleeping consciousness to
supply an answer to a question which had been asked
by waking consciousness.</p>

<p>The confusion of imagery may be more remote,
embodying abstract ideas and without reference to
recent impressions. Thus I dreamed that my wife
was expounding to me a theory by which the substitution
of slates for tiles in roofing had been accompanied
by, and intimately associated with, the
growing diminution of crime in England. I opposed
this theory, pointing out the picturesqueness of tiles,
their cheapness, and greater comfort both in winter and
summer, but at the same time it occurred to me as
a peculiar coincidence that tiles should have a sanguinary
tinge suggestive of criminal bloodthirstiness. I
need scarcely say that this bizarre theory had never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
suggested itself to my waking thoughts. There was,
however, a real connecting link in the confusion&mdash;the
redness, and it is a noteworthy point, of great significance
in the interpretation of dreams, that that link,
although clearly active from the first, remained subconscious
until the end of the dream, when it presented
itself as an entirely novel coincidence.</p>

<p>I dreamed once that I was with a doctor in his surgery,
and saw in his hand a note from a patient saying that
doctors were fools and did him no good, but he had
lately taken some <em>selvdrolla</em>, recommended by a friend,
and it had done him more good than anything, so
please send him some more. I saw the note clearly,
not, indeed, being conscious of reading it word by word,
but only of its meaning as I looked at it; the one word
I actually seemed to see, letter by letter, was the name
of the drug, and that changed and fluctuated beneath
my vision as I gazed at it, the final impression being
<em>selvdrolla</em>. The doctor took from a shelf a bottle
containing a bright yellow oleaginous fluid, and poured
a little out, remarking that it had lately come into
favour, especially in uric acid disorders, but was extremely
expensive. I expressed my surprise, having
never before heard of it. Then, again to my surprise,
he poured rather copiously from the bottle on to a
plate of food, saying, in explanation, that it was pleasant
to take and not dangerous. This was a vivid morning
dream, and on awakening I had no difficulty in detecting
the source of its various minor details, especially a
note received on the previous evening and containing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
a dubious figure, the precise nature of which I had
used my pocket lens to determine. But what was
<em>selvdrolla</em>, the most vivid element of the dream? I
sought vainly among my recent memories, and had
almost renounced the search when I recalled a large
bottle of salad oil seen on the supper table the previous
evening; not, indeed, resembling the dream bottle,
but containing a precisely similar fluid. <em>Selvdrolla</em>
was evidently a corruption of 'salad oil.' This dream
illustrates the uncertainty of dream consciousness, but
it also illustrates at the same time the element of
certainty in dream <em>subconsciousness</em>. Throughout my
dream I remained, consciously, in entire ignorance as to
the real nature of <em>selvdrolla</em>, yet a latent element in
consciousness was all the time presenting it to me in
ever clearer imagery. We see that the subconscious
element of dream life treats the conscious part much as
a good-natured teacher treats a child whose lesson is
only half learned, giving repeated clues and hints which
the stupid child understands only at the last moment,
or not at all. It is, indeed, a universal method, the
method of Nature with man, throughout the whole of
human evolution.</p>

<p>It will be seen that at this point we are brought into
contact with another characteristic of dream life:
there is often more in dreams than dreaming consciousness
is able to realise. On the one hand, the
elements of dream life are drawn from a wider field
than is normally accessible to waking consciousness;
on the other hand, the focus of dream consciousness is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
narrower than that of waking consciousness, and
cannot apperceive all that is going on. There is at
once more extension and more contraction than in the
psychic life of the waking world. A very large part
of the psychic life of sleep is outside our power, and
some of it is even beyond our sight.</p>

<p>It will be observed that the perpetual movement
and the constant fusion of images which constitute the
most fundamental character of dream life really combine
two characteristics which, abstractly regarded, are
distinct. The tendency of the dream image to be ever
changing, ever putting forth some new feature which
more or less radically alters its nature, is not a phenomenon
of precisely the same nature as the tendency for
two definite images, well known to waking consciousness,
to become fused together, consciously or unconsciously,
in dreams. Practically, however, there is
no line of demarcation. What happens is that the
image is ever spontaneously changing, and that each
change is at once recognised by dreaming consciousness
as a known object. Thus I dreamed that I was in a
drawing-room and saw a beautiful and attractive
woman with an unusually low evening dress entirely
revealing the breasts; then, between the breasts,
three additional nipples appeared, and I realised in
my dream that here was a case of supernumerary
breasts of sufficient scientific interest to be carefully
examined later on; and then, as I gazed, I saw a
number of little fleshy nipple-like protuberances on
the body, and thereupon I realised that I was really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
looking at a case of the rare skin disease termed
<em>molluscum fibrosum</em>. Thus the perpetually wavering
and developing image is at the same time a succession
of quite different images. On the other hand, when
we seem to have a fusion of two definite images, what
we really see in most cases is one image melting into the
other and gradually losing its earlier character. In
either case the process is the same interplay of automatic
peripheral imagery and central ideas, whether
the new image is brought into focus by, as it were, a
current in consciousness, or is merely suggested by a
spontaneous change in the previous image. How far
the image suggests the idea or the idea the image, it
is extremely difficult in most cases to say. The phenomenon
we witness is a perpetually dissolving view;
the vital process behind that phenomenon we must
usually be content to be ignorant of.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that the dream image is
slowly transformed without the dreamer realising the
transformation. Thus an image of a doll may take
on the character of a human being. In a dream of
this kind&mdash;possibly suggested by Villiers de l'Isle
Adam's <cite>L'Eve Future</cite>, though that book had not been
recently in my mind&mdash;I imagined that a lady of my
acquaintance (whose identity I could not recall on
awakening) had taken a fancy to possess an artificial
woman, constructed with vast ingenuity and at enormous
expense. The skin and hair seemed real as I noted
with a certain horror on observing the breasts and
armpits, but in places&mdash;I noticed especially one arm&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
creature was as defective as an ill-made doll. It
was, however, able to walk with a little support, and,
most remarkable of all, it gave intelligent answers to
questions; this alone it was that caused me a certain
surprise. What at the beginning of the dream had only
been an artificial image was evidently becoming a real
human being, and one can readily believe that such
stories as that of Pygmalion's statue may have been
suggested by dream experiences.</p>

<p>The dream is mainly a dissolving view, because for
most of us it is above all a visual phenomenon. Those
people who, in their dreams, at all events, if not also
in waking life, are largely of auditory type, experience
dreams in which words play exactly the same shifting,
developing, and dissolving part played by images in
the persons of more markedly visual type. In their
dreams they resemble those insane people who, in some
feeble and confusional states, manifest echolalia and
confabulation, their ideas drifting along the associational
paths of least resistance suggested by every
random word they hear. Maury records successions
of dream imagery strung together in a similar manner
by a procession of verbal transformations; thus in one
oft-quoted dream the scenes were connected by the
words, <em>kilom&egrave;tre</em>, <em>kilos</em>, <em>Gilolo</em>, <em>Lobelia</em>, <em>Lopez</em>, <em>loto</em>.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
In such a case the procession of verbal auditory imagery
constitutes the basis of the dream. This is probably
rare. In most people the basis of the dream is furnished
by visual imagery, and auditory images only occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
form an associative link, being more usually subordinated
to the visual elements.</p>

<p>The speech peculiarities of dreams have been very
thoroughly investigated by Kraepelin,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> who has brought
together two hundred and eighty-one examples, partly
observed in himself, though they are not common, and
Kraepelin considers that the hearing centres fall more
deeply asleep than the visual centres, the eyes being
already sufficiently protected by the lids.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Kraepelin
classifies the speech disturbances of dreams into two
great groups: (1) <em>paraphasia</em>, or disturbance of word-finding,
where the idea is associated with a wrong
word, which is sometimes a new formation<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>; and
(2) <em>disorders of oration</em>, in which the peculiarity lies,
not in the words, but in their order. The speech
disturbances of dreams, Kraepelin remarks, spring
from deep disturbance of thought, such as occur in
sensorial aphasia, and, as in such aphasia, the dreamer
thinks his nonsense is quite clear and reasonable. Much
the same may occur in alcoholic delirium and in <em>dementia
pr&aelig;cox</em>.</p>

<p>The invention of new words probably occurs frequently
in dreams, without leaving a clear trace in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
memory, and still more frequently, perhaps, as in the
'selvdrolla' dream, already recorded, there are seeming
new verbal formations which are really mere corruptions
of imperfectly realised words. An example of a
definite and precise new word seems to be furnished by
the following dream, which was at all points vivid and
precise. I saw quite close to me a huge tawny bird,
with an orange bill. The creature got up and moved
away, seeming as large as an ostrich. I asked a lady,
standing by, who had some ornithological knowledge,
what the bird was, and she replied that she thought it
was a <em>jaleisa</em>. Then I asked the same question of a
poor woman who was passing, curious to know what
she would answer; she said, 'Oh, it's a kind of starling.'
There was no doubt in my dream as to the spelling of
'jaleisa,' but I am quite unable to account for the word.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
It so happened, however, that before I went to bed I
had been reading one of Calderon's plays, and I imagine
that this pseudo-Spanish word had formed itself in my
brain among the echoes of Calderon's enchanting music.
The question arises as to why that ignorant old woman
should have called the jaleisa a starling. It seems just
possible that the more familiar name was suggested by
the last syllable of the strange bird's name, the association
being verbal. It is equally possible, and perhaps
more likely, that the association followed by the more
usual visual channel, and that the jaleisa's orange beak
suggested the large orange beaks of newly hatched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
starlings, which had once, many years previously,
vividly attracted my attention.</p>

<p>A probable illustration of the influence of verbal association
in diverting the current of a dream is seen in the
harrowing narrative that follows: A lady dreamed that
she went to an entertainment which turned out to be
a kind of revival meeting, presided over by a lady, and
full of uproar. It was suddenly realised that Hell was
underneath the hall, and a man, supposed to be a slave,
was torn to pieces and cast into Hell. A lady present
was so much affected by the scene that she threw herself
into a pool of water, and was drowned, her body
being afterwards pulled out by a working man with a
pitchfork. The dreamer was so overcome by these
tragic events that she felt that there was nothing left
but to commit suicide. Resolving to drown herself,
she went to a lighthouse (which, however, somewhat
resembled a bathing machine) on a height, in order
to throw herself down into the sea. It was of an exquisite
green tint, extremely lovely and attractive, but
she had not the courage to leap in. She thought it
might give her courage if she had a good meal first, so
she returned to the hall and joined the lady who had
presided over the meeting. They sat down to a dish
of roast mutton, but, as they were eating, suddenly
looked at each other with mutual understanding; they
realised that they were eating the woman who had been
drowned, and, it will be remarked, had been pulled out
of the water by a fork. It was possible to account for
every element of which this dream was made up, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
its tragic character was unsupported by anything in
waking life, and entirely native to the dream. The
possibility of any guiding link between 'Hell' and
'hall' had not presented itself to the dreamer, nor had
it occurred to me when I set down the dream as here
reproduced. It must be noted, however, that the
revival meeting would itself tend to suggest the idea
of Hell. It seems probable that verbal associations
usually play only a subordinate part.</p>

<p>Sometimes the verbal links of association in dreams,
far from introducing tragedy, lead, by the conjunction
of two words of the same sound, to puns. Thus a
dreamer imagined that he and some friends were looking
at a house with its bedroom or bedrooms open to
the air, the front wall being gone, and they were laughing
at the comical effect when a mysterious voice came
saying, 'A three-walled bedroom is a side-burst
stor(e)y.' As the dreamer awoke, he found himself
laughing at this juxtaposition of the idea of the storey
of a house-side split open, and the idea of a side-splitting
story. The conditions of psychic activity during sleep&mdash;when
ideas drift together from widely separated regions
along channels of association which are usually held
closed by the higher intellectual processes&mdash;seem,
indeed, to be specially favourable to the production of
puns and allied forms of witticism.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> They may, therefore,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>be properly regarded as closely associated with
subconscious activity.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>A verbal link is seen in the following 'recipe' invented
on another occasion by the same dreamer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">'Call in the tipcat, cut off its tail;</div>
  <div class="i1">Fold up some eggs in a saucepan;</div>
  <div class="i0">Sit on the rest, like an elderly male,</div>
  <div class="i1">And gulp down the whole as a horse can.'</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is evident that the tipcat suggested a cat's tail, while
the suggestion of a cooking recipe in 'cut off its tail'
led on to eggs and saucepan; the eggs suggested
'sitting,' while 'gulp,' as the dreamer noted, appeared
as 'gallop,' and suggested the horse. The ease with
which the whole fell into a completely rhymed doggerel
stanza is due to the fact that the dreamer is a poet.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>A more common phenomenon in my experience than
association by verbal clues is a transference from visual
terms into the terms of some other sense, and a repetition
in that form. Thus a lady dreams that a large
and very beautiful picture resembling tapestry forms
itself before her, and in it she sees herself, only much
more beautiful in shape, standing by a tree, and on the
other side of the tree an old friend is standing, while
there are a crowd of people around. Then she sees her
friend touch her on the arm. At the same time the
dreamer feels the touch. The visual image is reduplicated
in a motor form. Such a phenomenon is doubtless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
a natural result of the special conditions of dream
life. In waking life the senses are working co-ordinately,
and if we see ourselves touched we shall probably
feel ourselves touched. But in dreams the body is a
vision, and not our real body, and when we see it
touched, we realise we ought to feel it touched, and a
tactile sensation is thus suggested and experienced.</p>

<p>There are, however, other reduplications to which
this explanation will not apply. Thus I imagined I
was sitting at a window, at the top of a house, writing.
As I looked up from my table I saw, with all the emotions
naturally accompanying such a sight, a woman in
her nightdress appear at a lofty window some distance
off, and throw herself down. I went on writing, however,
and found that in the course of my literary employment&mdash;I
am not clear as to its precise nature&mdash;the
very next thing I had to do was to describe exactly
such a scene as I had just witnessed. I was extremely
puzzled at such an extraordinary coincidence; it seemed
to me wholly inexplicable. Again I dreamed that I
was coming up the Thames (apparently in a steamboat),
reading a novel, written by a friend, which was the
history of some one who arrives in England coming
up the Thames to London, by what I felt to be an
extraordinary coincidence, in exactly the same way as
I was at the moment. Then I found myself seemingly
at the end of a London pier, with the river rippling at
my feet, and in front the superb panorama of London;
exactly the scene which, in less detail, was described in
the book. Such dreams, reduplicating the imagery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
in a new sensory medium, are fairly common, with me
at all events. The association is less that of analogy
than of sensory media, as of the visual image becoming
a verbal motor image. In other cases a scene is first
seen as in reality, and then in a picture. Thus I
dreamed that I was witnessing the performance of an
orchestra, and observed that all the players had instruments
of ancient pattern which, I understood, had been
in constant use for several hundred years; I could
recall the shapes of many on awaking, and none of them
were quite modern; I could not, however, recall the
character of the music, which seemed to make no impression
on me, since I was absorbed in observing the
shapes of the instruments. I specially observed an
old framed engraving hanging on the wall, in my dream,
representing precisely one of the instruments played
on, and I understood that it was called a <em>bourdon</em>.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
It is interesting to observe the profound astonishment
with which sleeping consciousness apperceives such
simple reduplication.</p>

<p>In dreams planes of existence that in waking life
are fundamentally distinct are brought together, so
that events belonging to different planes move on the
same plane, and even become combined. Acting and
life, the picture and the reality, are no longer absolutely
distinct. Art and life flow in the same channel. The
reason, doubtless, is that for the dreamer the world of
waking life, the world of things as they are to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
waking senses, is closed and cannot even be completely
recalled. So that all modes of representation are
strictly on the same level, and it is, therefore, perfectly
natural and logical that they should stand side by side
and merge into one another.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="p6">THE LOGIC OF DREAMS</p>

<blockquote>

<p>All Dreaming is a Process of Reasoning&mdash;The Fundamental Character
of Reasoning&mdash;Reasoning as a Synthesis of Images&mdash;Dream
Reasoning Instinctive and Automatic&mdash;It is also Consciously
carried on&mdash;This a result of the Fundamental Split in Intelligence&mdash;Dissociation&mdash;Dreaming
as a Disturbance of Apperception.</p></blockquote>


<p>I<span class="smcapa">N</span> dreams we are always reasoning. That is a general
characteristic of dreams which is worth noting, because
its significance is not usually recognised. It is sometimes
imagined that reason is in abeyance during sleep.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
So far from this being the case, we may almost be said
to reason much more during sleep than when we are
awake. That our reasoning is bad, often even preposterous,
that it constantly ignores the most elementary
facts of waking life, scarcely affects the question.
All dreaming is a process of reasoning. That artful
confusion of ideas and images which, at the outset, I
referred to as the most constant feature of dream
mechanism is nothing but a process of reasoning, a
perpetual effort to argue out harmoniously the absurdly
limited and incongruous data present to sleeping consciousness.
Binet, grounding his conclusions on
hypnotic experiments, finds that reasoning is the fundamental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
part of all thinking, the very texture of thought.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
It is founded on perception itself, which already contains
all the elements of the ancient syllogism. For in
all perception, as Binet plausibly argues, there is a
succession of three images, of which the first fuses with
the second, which, in its turn, suggests the third. Now
this establishment of new associations, this construction
of images, which, as we may easily convince ourselves,
is precisely what takes place in dreaming, is reasoning
itself.</p>

<p>Reasoning may thus be regarded as a synthesis of
images suggested by resemblance and contiguity, indeed
a sort of logical vision, more intense even than
actual vision, since it is capable of producing hallucinations.
To reasoning all forms of mental activity may
finally be reduced; mind, as Wundt has said, is a thing
that reasons. Or, as H. R. Marshall puts it, 'reason is
a mode of instinct.'<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> When we apply these general
statements to dreaming, we may see that the whole
phenomenon of dreaming is really the same process of
image formation, based on resemblance and contiguity.
Every dream is the outcome of this strenuous, wide-ranging
instinct to reason. The supposed 'imaginative
faculty,' regarded as so highly active during sleep, is
the inevitable play of this automatic logic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>The syllogistic arrangement of dream imagery is
carried on in an absolutely automatic manner; it is
spontaneous, involuntary, without effort. Sleeping
consciousness, though all the time it is weaving the data
that reach it into some pattern of reason with immense
ingenuity, is quite unaware that it is itself responsible
for the arguments thus presented. In the evening,
before going to bed, I glance casually through a newspaper;
I see the usual kind of news, revolutionists in
Russia, Irish affairs, crimes, etc.; I see also a caricature
of the Liberal Party as a headless horseman on a
barren plain. During sleep these unconnected impressions
revive, float into dream consciousness, and spontaneously
fall into as reasonable a whole as could be
expected. I dream that by some chemical or mechanical
device a man has succeeded in conveying the impression
that he is headless, and is preparing to gallop across
some district in Russia, with the idea of making so
mysterious an impression upon the credulous population
that he will be accepted as a great religious
prophet. I distinctly see him careering across sands
like those of the seashore, but I avoid going near him.
Then I see figures approaching him in the far distance,
and his progress ceases. I learn subsequently that he
has been arrested and found to be an Irish criminal. A
coherent story is thus formed out of a few random
impressions.</p>

<p>All such typical dreams are syllogistic. There is,
that is to say, as Binet expresses it, the establishment
of an association between two states of consciousness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
by means of an intermediate state which resembles the
first, is associated with the second, and by fusing with
the first associates it with the second. In this dream,
for instance, we have the three terms of (1) headless
horseman, (2) revolutionary crime, and (3) Russia and
Ireland. The intermediate term, by the fact that it
resembles the first, and is contiguous in the mind with
the third, seems to fuse the first and the third terms, so
that the headless horseman becomes an Irish criminal
in Russia. In dreaming life, as in waking life, our minds
are always moving by the construction of similar syllogisms,
marked by more or less freedom and audacity.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to multiply examples of the instinctive
and persistent efforts on the part of the sleeping
mind to construct a coherent whole out of the incongruous
elements that come before it; nearly every
dream furnishes some proof of this profoundly rooted impulse.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
It is instructive, however, to consider the
nature and the limitations of dreaming reason.</p>

<p>This rationalisation and logical construction of
imagery, it is necessary to realise, occurs at the very
threshold of sleeping consciousness. The dreamer
makes no effort to arrange isolated imagery; the
arrangement has already occurred when the imagery
comes to the focus of sleeping consciousness; so that
this reasoning and arranging process is so fundamental
and instinctive that it occurs in a region which may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
said to be subconscious to dreaming consciousness. If
it were not so our dreams would never be real to us, for
even dreaming consciousness could not accept as real
a hallucination which it had itself arranged. In this
sense it is true that, to some extent, our dreams are often
based on an ultimate personal and emotional foundation.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>But this ingeniously guided and rationalised confusion
of imagery by no means covers the whole of the
reasoning process in dreams. This is a double process.
It is first manifested subconsciously in the formation
of dream imagery, and then it is manifested consciously
in the dreamer's reaction to the imagery presented to
him. Every dream is made up of action and reaction
between a pseudo-universe and a freely responding
individual. On the one side there is the irresistibly
imposed imagery&mdash;really, though we know it not,
conditioned and instinctively moulded by our own
organism&mdash;which stands for what in our waking hours
we may term God and Nature; on the other side is the
Soul struggling with all its might, and very inefficient
means, against the awful powers that oppose it. The
problem of the waking world is presented over again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
in this battle between the dreaming protagonist and his
dreamed fate. Both of these elements are instinctively
reasoned out, consciously or subconsciously; both are
imperfect fragments from the rich reservoir of human
personality.</p>

<p>The things that happen to us in dreams, the pseudo-external
world that is presented to sleeping consciousness&mdash;the
imagery, that is, that floats before the mental
eye of sleep&mdash;are a perpetual source of astonishment
and argument to the dreamer. A large part of dreaming
activity is concerned with the attempt to explain and
reason out the phenomena we thus encounter, to construct
a theory of them, or to determine the attitude
which we ought to take up with regard to them. Most
dreams will furnish evidence of this reasoning process.</p>

<p>Thus a lady dreamed that an acquaintance wished to
send a small sum of money to a person in Ireland. She
rashly offered to take it over to Ireland. On arriving
home she began to repent of her promise, as the weather
was extremely wild and cold. She proceeded, however,
to make preparations for dressing warmly, and went to
consult an Irish friend, who said she would have to be
floated over to Ireland tightly jammed in a crab basket.
On returning home she fully discussed the matter with
her husband, who thought it would be folly to undertake
such a journey, and she finally relinquished it, with
great relief. In this dream&mdash;the elements of which
could all be accounted for&mdash;the association between
sending money and the post-office, which would at once
occur to waking consciousness, was closed; consciousness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
was a prey to such suggestions as reached it, but on
the basis of those suggestions it reasoned and concluded
quite sagaciously.</p>

<p>Again (after looking at photographs of paintings and
statuary, and also reading about the theatre), I
dreamed that I was at the theatre, and that the performers
were acting and dancing in a more or less, in
some cases completely, nude state, but with admirable
propriety and grace, and very charming effect. At
first I was extremely surprised at so remarkable an
innovation; but then I reflected that the beginnings
of such a movement must have long been in progress
on the stage unknown to me; and I proceeded to
rehearse the reasons which made such a movement
desirable. On another occasion, I dreamed that I was
in the large <em>plaza</em> of a Spanish city (Pamplona possibly
furnishing the elements of the picture), and that the
governor emerged from his residence facing the square
and began talking in English to the subordinate officials
who were waiting to receive him. The real reason why
he talked English was, of course, the simple one that
he spoke the language native to the dreamer. But in
my dream I was extremely puzzled why he should speak
English. I looked carefully into his face to assure
myself that he was not really English, and I finally
concluded that he was speaking English in order not
to be understood by the bystanders. Once more, I
dreamed that I was looking at an architectural drawing
of a steeple, of quite original design, somewhat in the
shape of a cross, but very elongated. I attempted in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
my dream to account for this elongation, and concluded
that it was intended to neutralise the foreshortening
caused when the steeple would be looked at from below.</p>

<p>There is, we here see afresh, a fundamental split
in dreaming intelligence. On the one side there is the
subconscious, yet often highly intelligent, combination
of imagery along rational although often bizarre lines.
On the other side is concentrated the conscious intelligence
of the dreamer, struggling to comprehend and
explain the problems offered by the pseudo-external
imagery thus presented to it. One might almost say
that in dreams subconscious intelligence is playing a
game with conscious intelligence. In a dream previously
narrated (p. 43) subconscious intelligence offered
to my dreaming consciousness the mysterious substance
<em>selvdrolla</em>, and bid me guess what it was; I could not
guess. And subconscious intelligence presented the
drawing of the elongated steeple, and I was able to offer
an explanation which seems fairly satisfactory. So
that, in the world of dreams, it may be said, we see over
again the process which, James Hinton was accustomed
to say, we see in the universe of our waking life; God
or Nature playing with man, compelling him to join
in a game of hide-and-seek, and setting him problems
which he must solve as best he can. It may well be,
one may add, that the dream process furnishes the key
to the metaphysical and even, indeed, the physical
problems of our waking thoughts, and that the puzzles
of the universe are questions that we ourselves unconsciously
invent for ourselves to solve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>We can never go behind the fantastic universe of our
dreams. The validity of that universe is for dreaming
consciousness unassailable. We may try to understand
it and explain it, but we can never deny it, any
more than we can deny the universe of our waking life,
however we may attempt to analyse it. Dreaming
consciousness never realises that the universe that
confronts it springs from the same source as itself springs.
I dreamed that a man was looking at his own house
from a distance, and on the balcony he saw his daughter
and a man by her side. 'Who is that man flirting with
my daughter?' he asked. He produced a field-glass,
and, on looking through it, he exclaimed: 'Good
Heavens, it's myself!' Dreaming consciousness
accepted this situation with perfect equanimity and
solemnity. In the dream world there is, indeed, nothing
else to do. We may puzzle over the facts presented to
us; we may try to explain them; but it would be
futile to deny them, even when they involve the possibility
of a man being in two places at the same time.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>Only to a few people there comes occasionally in
dreams a dim realisation of the unreality of the experience:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
'After all, it does not matter,' they are able
to say to themselves with more or less conviction, 'this
is only a dream.' Thus one lady, dreaming that she is
trying to kill three large snakes by stamping on them,
wonders, while still dreaming, what it signifies to dream
of snakes,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and another lady, when she dreams that she
is in any unpleasant position&mdash;about to be shot, for
instance&mdash;often says to herself: 'Never mind, I shall
wake before it happens.'</p>

<p>I have never detected in my own dreams any recognition
that they are dreams. I may say, indeed, that
I do not consider that such a thing is really possible,
though it has been borne witness to by many philosophers
and others from Aristotle and Synesius and
Gassendi onwards. The phenomenon occurs; the
person who says to himself that he is dreaming believes
that he is still dreaming, but one may be permitted to
doubt that he is. It seems far more probable that he
has for a moment, without realising it, emerged at the
waking surface of consciousness.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> The only approach
to a recognition of dreaming as dreaming that I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
experienced, is connected with the reduplication that
may sometimes occur, and the sense of a fatalistic
predetermination. Thus I dreamed (with nothing that
could suggest the dream) that I was one of a group of
people who, as I realised, were carrying out a drama
in which by force of circumstance I was destined to be
the villain, having, by bad treatment, been driven to
revenge. I knew at the outset how events would turn
out, and yet, though it seemed real life, I felt vaguely
that it was all a play that was merely being rehearsed.
I had attained in the world of dreams to the Shakespearian
feeling that it was all a stage, and I merely a
player. So we may become the Prosperos of the life
of dreams.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>This quality of dreaming consciousness is a manifestation,
and the chief one, of what is called <em>dissociation</em>.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
In dissociation we have a phenomenon which
runs through the whole of the dreaming life, and is
scarcely less fundamental than the process of fusion
by which the imagery is built up. The fact that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
reasoning of dreams is usually bad, is due partly to the
absence of memory elements that would be present
to waking consciousness, and partly to the absence of
sensory elements to check the false reasoning which,
without them, appears to us conclusive. That is to
say, that there is a process of dissociation by which
ordinary channels of association are temporarily blocked,
perhaps by exhaustion of their conductive elements, and
the conditions are prepared for the formation of the
hallucination. It is, as Parish has argued, in sleep and
in those sleep-resembling states called hypnagogic
that a condition of dissociation leading to hallucination
is most apt to occur.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>Thus it is that though the psychic frontier of the
sleeping state is more extended than that of the normal
waking state, the focus of sleeping consciousness is more
contracted than that of waking consciousness. In
other words, while facts are liable to drift from a very
wide psychic distance under our dreaming attention,
we cannot direct the searchlight of that attention at
will over so wide a field as when we are awake. We deal
with fewer psychic elements, though those elements
are drawn from a wider field.</p>

<p>The psychology of 'attention' is, indeed, a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
disputed matter.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> There is no agreement as to whether
it is central or peripheral, motor or sensory. As we have
seen in the previous chapter, it seems reasonable to
conclude, according to a convenient distinction established
by Ribot, that spontaneous attention is persistent
during sleep, but voluntary attention is at a
minimum. In some such way, it seems, whatever
theory of attention we adopt, we have to recognise that
in dreams the attention is limited.</p>

<p>Such a position is fortified by the conclusion of those
who look at the problem, not so much in terms of
attention as in terms of apperception. Apperception,
according to Wundt, differs from perception in that
while the latter is the appearance of a content in consciousness,
the former is its reception into the state of
attention. Or, as Stout defines it, apperception is 'the
process by which a mental system appropriates a new
element, or otherwise receives a fresh determination.'<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
Apperception is, therefore, the final stage of attention,
and ultimately, as Wundt remarks, it is one with will.
Apperception and will, as most psychologists consider,
like attention, are enfeebled and diminished, if not
abolished, in sleep.</p>

<p>In dreams, it thus comes about, we accept the facts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
presented to us&mdash;that is the fundamental assumption
of dream life&mdash;and we argue about those 'facts' with
the help of all the mental resources which are at our
disposal, only those resources are frequently inadequate.
Sometimes they are startlingly inadequate, to such an
extent, indeed, that we are unaware of possibilities
which would be the very first to suggest themselves to
waking consciousness. Thus the lady who wished to
send a small sum of money to Ireland is not aware of
the existence of postal orders, and when she decides to
convey the money herself, she is not aware of the
existence of boat-trains, or even of boats; she might
have been living in palaeolithic times. She discusses
the question in a clear and logical manner with the
resources at her disposal, and reaches a rational conclusion,
but considerations which would be the first
to occur to waking consciousness are at the moment
absent from sleeping consciousness; whole mental
tracts have been dissociated, switched off from communication
with consciousness; they are 'asleep,' even to
sleeping consciousness.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>The result is that we are not only dominated by the
suggestion of our visions, but we are unable adequately
to appreciate and criticise the situations which are
presented to us. We instinctively continue to reason,
and to reason clearly and logically with the material at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
our disposal, but our reasoning is hopelessly absurd.
We perceive in dreams, but we do not apperceive;
we cannot, that is to say, test and sift the new experience,
and co-ordinate it adequately with the whole
body of our acquired mental possessions. The phenomena
of dreaming furnish a delightful illustration of
the fact that reasoning, in its rough form, is only the
crudest and most elementary form of intellectual
operation, and that the finer forms of thinking involve
much more than logic. 'All the thinking in the world,'
as Goethe puts it, 'will not lead us to thought.'</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="p6">THE SENSES IN DREAMS</p>

<blockquote>

<p>All Dreams probably contain both Presentative and Representative
Elements&mdash;The Influence of Tactile Sensations on Dreams&mdash;Dreams
excited by Auditory Stimuli&mdash;Dreams aroused by Odours
and Tastes&mdash;The Influence of Visual Stimuli&mdash;Difficulty of distinguishing
between Actual and Imagined Sensory Excitations&mdash;The
Influence of Internal Visceral Stimuli on Dreaming&mdash;Erotic
Dreams&mdash;Vesical Dreams&mdash;Cardiac Dreams and their Symbolism&mdash;Prodromic
Dreams&mdash;Prophetic Dreams.</p></blockquote>


<p>At the outset I adopted provisionally the usual classification
of dreams into two classes: the peripheral or
presentative group, excited by a stimulus from without,
and the central or representative group, having its
elements in memories. If, however, we look carefully
at the matter, in the light of the experiences which we
have encountered, it will be found that this classification,
however superficially convenient it may be,
fails to correspond to any radical duality of dream
phenomena. When we closely question our dream
experiences, it ceases to be clear that they really fall
into two groups at all.</p>

<p>On the one hand, it would appear that most, perhaps,
indeed, all dreams that are sufficiently vivid to be
clearly remembered on awakening, have received an
initial stimulus from some external, or at all events,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
peripheral source.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> There is something unusual or
uncomfortable in the sleeper's position, or he has been
subjected to some slight unusual strain which has
modified his nervous condition, or there has been some
deviation from his usual diet, or a physiological stress
of some kind is making itself felt within him&mdash;careful
self-questioning constantly reveals the actual or probable
existence of some external or certainly peripheral
stimulus of this kind. So that we seem entitled to say
that in all dreams there is probably a presentative
element.</p>

<p>On the other hand, an even more cursory investigation
of our dream life suffices to show that in every
dream there is also a representative element. No
dream can be said to be strictly and literally presentative.
If, when I am seemingly asleep, a person speaks to me,
and I become conscious that he is present and speaking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
I am not entitled to say that I 'dream' it. A consciousness
which perceives facts in the same way as
they may be perceived by waking consciousness is not
a dreaming consciousness. So that there are, in the
literal sense, no presentative dreams. What happens
is that the stimulus, instead of being presented directly
to consciousness, and recognised for what it is to waking
consciousness, serves to arouse old memories and ideas
which dream consciousness accepts as a reasonable
explanation of the external or peripheral stimulus.
The stimulus may be said to be, in a sense, the cause
of the dream, but the dream itself remains central,
and as truly a combined picture of mental images as
though there were no known peripheral stimulus at all.</p>

<p>Thus, while it is true that the division of dreams
into two classes corresponds to a recognisable distinction,
it is yet a superficial and unimportant distinction.
It is likely that all dreams have a peripheral or presentative
element, and certain that they all have a
central or representative element. This will become
clearer if we now proceed to discuss those dreams which
have, demonstrably, their exciting cause in some external
or internal organic stimulus.</p>

<p>The world which we enter through the portal of sleep
presents such obvious and serious limitations that we
are apt to under-estimate its real richness and variety.
In some respects, indeed, we can accomplish in sleep
what is beyond our reach awake. Thus it sometimes
happens that we reason better in sleep than when awake,
that we may find in dreams the solutions of difficulties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
which escape us awake, and that we may remember
things which, when awake, we had forgotten. But
even within the ordinary range of experience, it is interesting
to note that our dreams contain the same
elements as our waking life. The sensory activities
which stir us during the day are equally active, though
in strange transformations, in the world of dreams.</p>

<p>It is probable that all the senses may furnish the
medium through which stimuli may reach sleeping
consciousness; though touch and hearing are doubtless
the main channels to dream life. The eyes are closed,
so that while the chief parts of our dream life are in
terms of vision, direct visual stimuli can only be a
very dim and uncertain influence. But no sense is
absolutely excluded from activity in dreams.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>Heat or cold sensations and pressure sensations, as
well as their anaesthetic absence, undoubtedly play an
important part in explaining various kinds of dreams.
They do not necessarily result in rememberable dreams,
even although it is possible that they still affect the
current of sleeping consciousness. It is possible to press
and massage the body of a sleeper all over, gently but
firmly, without interrupting sleep. When the pressure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
reaches a considerable degree of vigour, the sleeper may
move a muscle, perhaps the lips, even an arm, may go
so far as to half wake and move the whole body. All
these movements suggest that they have accompaniments
on the psychic side, yet, on finally awakening,
the sleeper may be unable to recall any memory of the
occurrence, or any vestige of a dream.</p>

<p>In a certain proportion of cases, however, a dream
results. Thus a lady dreams that, with a number of
other people, she is on board a ship which is rocking
heavily, and on awakening she finds that her large
dog is on the bed, vigorously scratching himself. The
ship has clearly been the theory invented by sleeping
consciousness to account for the unfamiliar sensations
of movement.</p>

<p>When living in the south of Spain, I awoke early one
morning, and heard a mosquito buzzing. I fell asleep
again and dreamed that a huge insect&mdash;as large as a
lobster, but flat like a cockroach, and scarlet in colour&mdash;had
alighted on my hand. The creature had two long
horns, and from each of these proceeded numerous very
long and delicate filaments which were inserted into my
hand to a considerable depth. I had to cut the creature
in half, and draw away the forepart, which was attached
to my hand, with great care lest I should leave portions
of the filaments in the flesh. This animal seemed all
the more unpleasant because it was noiseless, and its
attacks, I thought, imperceptible. I appeared to be
attacked by a succession of them. On awakening,
there was irritation of the left wrist, as though the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
mosquito had bitten me, although I had long ceased to
be bitten by mosquitoes. This dream, it will be seen,
corresponds in an unusually close way to the idea of a
presentative dream; imagination followed reality in
presenting an insect as the cause of the sensation experienced
(possibly because I had actually heard the
mosquito when awake), but still, as in all dreams, the
process was mainly central, and imagination was freely
exercised in creating a creature adequate to explain
the doubtless vague and massive cutaneous sensations
transmitted to sleeping consciousness.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps one of the commonest skin sensations to
excite dream formation is that of cold due to disturbance
of the bed coverings. The following example may
serve as an illustration of this class. I dreamed that I
was in an hotel, mounting many flights of stairs, until
I entered a room where the chambermaid was making
the bed; the white bedclothes were scattered over
everything, and looked to me like snow; then I became
conscious that I was very cold, and it appeared to me
that I really was surrounded by snow, for the chambermaid
remarked that I was very courageous to come up
so high in the hotel, very few people venturing to do so
on account of the great cold at this height. I awoke to
find that it was a cold night, and that I was entangled
in the sheets, and partly uncovered. Nothing else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
had occurred to suggest this dream which sleeping
consciousness had elaborated out of the two associated
ideas of altitude and snow in order to explain the actual
sensations experienced. It is noteworthy that, as in
the dream just before narrated, there was here also a
link with reality, this time furnished by the disarranged
bedclothes.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>The auditory experiences of dreams, to a greater
extent perhaps than those involving the sense of
touch, may be based on spontaneous disturbances
within the sensory mechanism. This is notably also
the case with visual experiences, and in many respects
the conditions in the ear are analogous. Apart from
increased resonance of the ear, or hyperaesthesia of the
auditory nerve, producing special sensitiveness to sounds,
an increased flow of blood through the ear, as well as
muscular contractions and mucous plugs in the external
ear, furnish the faint rudimentary noises which, in sleep,
may constitute the nucleus around which hallucinations
crystallise. Disease of the ear may obviously act in
the same way, but, even apart from actual disease,
various nervous disturbances favour the production
of auditory hallucinations during sleep, and, in marked
cases, even awake.</p>

<p>We may dream of listening to music in the absence
of all external sounds having any musical character.
In such cases, no doubt, the actual conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
within the auditory mechanism are suggesting music
to the brain, but the resulting music seems usually to
be less definite, less rememberable, than when it forms
around the nucleus of an external series of sounds.
In many of these cases it is probable that we do not
hear music in our dream; we are simply under conditions
in which we imagine that we hear music. Thus,
on going to bed soon after supper, but not perceptibly
suffering from indigestion, I dreamed that I was present
at a public meeting combined with an orchestral concert.
A speech was to be made by a man who looked
like an old sailor or soldier, and meanwhile the
orchestra was playing. The speaker&mdash;unaccustomed, I
gathered, to the etiquette of such a meeting&mdash;suddenly
interrupted the orchestra by a remark, and the surprised
conductor stopped the performance for a moment and
then continued, subsequent remarks by the speaker
failing to affect the music, which continued to the end,
becoming more lively and vigorous in character. But
what the music was, I knew not at the time, nor could I
recall any fragment of it on awakening. It is even
possible that such a dream is mainly visual, and that no
hallucinatory music is heard, its occurrence being merely
deduced from the nature of the vision.</p>

<p>If the dreams evoked by sounds within the ear are
usually difficult to trace in normal persons under
ordinary circumstances, this is not the case with dreams
suggested by sounds which strike the ear from without.
These constitute one of the most interesting groups
of dreams as well as one of the easiest to explain, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
they are very frequent.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Their mechanism may,
indeed, be observed under some circumstances even in
the waking state. In some persons, music, a voice, a
bird's song, even a word, a comment, arouse phantoms
of colour and form, light and shade, coloured clouds,
streams, waves, etc. The phenomena are especially
rich when produced by an orchestra. Such 'music-phantoms,'
as they are termed, are a special and freer
development of the narrow and rigid phenomena of
'colour-hearing.' They have been studied by Dr.
Ruths.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> We have to remember that music possesses a
fundamental motor basis. As Dauriac remarks, music
may be defined as 'movement clothed with sound.'<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
It tends to produce movement, or, failing movement,
to produce motor imagery.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>Dreams excited by definite external auditory stimuli
may be of various character. A not uncommon source&mdash;especially
for those who live on a wind-swept coast&mdash;is
the occurrence of storms. A lady dreams, for instance,
that her little dog has fallen off a high cliff and that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
hears his shrieks; it was an extremely windy night, and
her window was open. The dream has some resemblance
to one which Burdach recorded that he shared with a companion
in an hotel during a storm; they both dreamed
they were wandering at night among high precipices.</p>

<p>On one occasion I awoke in the middle of a windy
night imagining I had been listening to an opera of
Gluck's (which in reality I had never heard), and experiencing
all the sense of delicious waves of melody
which one actually experiences in listening to such
operas as <em>Alceste</em>. A fragment of a melody I had heard
in the dream still persisted in my memory on awaking,
so that I could mentally repeat it, when it seemed as
agreeable as in the dream, though unfamiliar.</p>

<p>The following dream had also a similar origin. I
imagined that I was assisting at a spectacle of somewhat
dubious erotic character, in company with other persons
who, out of modesty, covered their faces with their
hands with the decorous gesture which recalled (as
dream consciousness evidently realised) that of people
during prayer in church. Thereupon a beautiful voice
was heard in the background loudly chanting a versicle
of the Te Deum. This awoke me, and I seemed to
realise when half awake that the voice I had heard in
the dream was a real voice. There had, however, been
no real voice, only the loud howling of the wind and the
beating of the rain on the window panes.</p>

<p>Once, on a very windy night, and when, perhaps,
suffering a trifling disturbance of health&mdash;for there was
slight pleurodynic pain the next morning&mdash;I dreamed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
I was quietly at home with friends, when suddenly the
sky became illuminated. We found that this was due
to steady and continuous lightning, a state of things
which remained throughout the dream, the sky presenting
the appearance of a cracked and crushed sheet
of melting ice.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> By and by, fragments of buildings
and similar debris were whirled past in the air, and I
caught sight of a woman driven above me by her skirts.
We now realised the imminent approach of a terrific
cyclone which, at any moment, might carry the house
and ourselves away. I remembered no more.</p>

<p>Yet another dream may be mentioned as likewise
directly due to a violent storm and the rattling of a
window near my bed. The latter sound evidently
recalled to sleeping consciousness the sound of the
rattling window of a railway train, and I dreamed that
I was travelling to Berlin with a medical friend. There
were the accompaniments, not unfamiliar in dreams,
of rushing along interminable platforms, and up and
down endless stairs, finding myself in a carriage of the
wrong class, with, in consequence, more wandering along
corridors, and finally finding that my friend had been
left behind. The character of the dream may have been
influenced by slight indigestion. In this dream, unlike
those already recorded as due to external stimuli, the
elements of the dream were not the pure invention of
dreaming imagination, but compacted entirely of ideas
that had been recently familiar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>The following dream was due to an auditory stimulus
of different character. I dreamed that I was listening
to a performance of Haydn's <cite>Creation</cite>, the orchestral
part of the performance seeming to consist chiefly of the
very realistic representation of the song of birds, though
I could not identify the note of any particular bird.
Then followed solos by male singers, whom I saw,
especially one who attracted my attention by singing
at the close in a scarcely audible voice. On awakening,
the source of the dream was not immediately obvious,
but I soon realised that it was the song of a canary in
another room. I had never heard Haydn's <cite>Creation</cite>,
except in fragments, nor thought of it at any recent
period; its reputation as regards the realistic representation
of natural sounds had evidently caused it to
be put forward by sleeping consciousness as a plausible
explanation of the sounds heard, and the visual centres
had accepted the theory.</p>

<p>However far-fetched and improbable our dreams may
seem to the waking mind, they are, from the point of
view of the sleeping mind, serious and careful attempts
to construct an adequate theory of the phenomena.
The imagery is sought from far afield only to fit the facts
more accurately. Thus a lady dreamed that her dog
was being crushed out flat in a large old-fashioned box-mangle.
She awoke to find that water from a burst
pipe was falling from the ceiling on to the floor on the
landing outside her door, close to where the dog had his
bed. She had never seen a mangle of this kind since
she was a child, or had any occasion to think of it, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the rhythm and sound of it somewhat resembled that
of the falling water.</p>

<p>One more example of an auditory dream may be given.
I dreamed that I was back in a schoolroom of my boyhood,
with two or three of the present masters. The
room had been entirely changed, and it contained much
new school apparatus and, notably, on a table, several
miniature engines, of different character, actually working.
I said to the masters that I wished all these
apparatus had been there twenty years ago (a considerable
under-estimate of the actual interval since I left
that schoolroom), so that I might have enjoyed the
benefit of them. 'All life is made up of machinery,'
I found myself uttering aloud as I awoke, 'and unless
you understand machinery you can't understand life.'
It was not till some moments later that I became
conscious of a faint whirring sound which puzzled me
till I realised that it was the sound of distant machinery
entering through the open window. This had, undoubtedly,
suggested the engines of the dream, though
I had not been conscious in my dream of hearing any
sounds, and the small size of the dream engines corresponded
to the faintness of the actual sounds.</p>

<p>Dreams aroused by odours do not usually seem to
occur except on the experimental application of them
to the sleeper's nostrils, and experiments in this direction
are not usually successful.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Occasionally, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>smell dreams occur without any traceable sensory
source, and Grace Andrews, for instance, records a
dream of the sea, accompanied by the seashore odour,
'a pure and rich sensation of smell.' In my own case
olfactory dreams have been rare and insignificant.</p>

<p>Taste, as we usually understand it, really involves,
as is well known, an element of smell, and taste dreams
of this kind seem to occur from time to time under the
influence of any slight disturbance of the mucous
membrane of the mouth or slight indigestion. It is
possible that the latter element was present in the
following dream: I imagined that, following the example
of a friend, I gave some cigarettes to a tramp we
had casually met, and that, in return, we felt compelled
to drink some raw gin he carried. I did so with some
misgiving as to the possible results of drinking from a
tramp's flask, but although in real life I had not tasted
gin for many years, the hot burning taste of the spirit
was very distinct. On awakening, my lips seemed hot
and dry, and it was doubtless this labial sensation which
led dream consciousness to seek a plausible explanation
in cigarettes and spirits. Although the spirit seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
have the specific flavour of gin, it is always difficult, if
not impossible, in dream sensations, to distinguish
between what one feels and what one merely concludes
that one feels. In such a case, that is to say, it remains
doubtful whether the labial sensation evokes the specific
hallucination of gin, or whether it merely suggests to
sleeping consciousness that the gin has been tasted,
much as it is possible to suggest to the hypnotised
person that the substance he is tasting is a quite
different substance, that salt is sugar, or that water
is wine.</p>

<p>As with dreams of smell, it is not always possible to
detect any external stimulation as the cause for a taste
or pseudo-taste dream.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> This may be illustrated by a
dream which belongs strictly to the tactile class; I
dreamed that I called upon a medical acquaintance
whose assistant I found in a dark surgery. I absently
took up a broken medicine bottle and put it to my
mouth, when my friend came in. I spoke to him on
some medical topic, but he entered his carriage, and was
driven off before he had time to answer me. I then
found that my mouth was full of fragments of broken
colourless glass, which I carefully removed. This
dream was constructed, in the manner which has
been often illustrated in the previous pages, of small
separate incidents which had occurred during the
immediately preceding days. One of the incidents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
was the fact that I had myself smashed a little coloured
(not colourless) glass and carefully picked up the fragments.
But the vividest part of the dream was the
sensation of broken glass in the mouth, and on awaking
no sensation could be detected in the mouth. So that
though the most plausible explanation of such a dream
would be the theory that the recent experience with
broken glass had suggested to sleeping consciousness
the explanation of an unpleasant sensation actually
experienced in the mouth, there was nothing whatever
to support that theory.</p>

<p>The falling of light on the closed eyes, or the half
opening of the eyes, has been found to serve as a visual
stimulus to dreams, but I have myself no decisive
evidence on this point.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> In the case of a lady who
dreamed that a lover was in her room, and that suddenly
the door opened, and she saw her mother standing before
her with a bright light, which awoke her, she could
find nothing in the room, no light, to account for the
dream. It is, of course, unnecessary for a dream of a
bright light to be actually produced by an external
visual stimulus accompanying the dream, for the
spontaneous retino-cerebral activity itself produces
sensations of light. Thus, on the night after a pleasant
walk in a country lane through which the setting sun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
shone, I dreamed that I was walking along a lane in
which I saw a bright light and my own vast shadow in
front of me. It would seem that, on the whole, the
curtain of the eyelids effectually shuts out light from
the eye during sleep, and that the sense which is more
active during the day than any other is the most carefully
guarded of all during the night. The peculiarly
delicate and unstable nature of the chemical basis of
vision makes up for this protection from external
stimulation, and by its spontaneous activity ensures
that even in dreams vision is the predominant
sense.</p>

<p>What we find as regards the part played in dreams
by excitations arising from the external specific senses
holds good also for excitations arising from internal
organic sensations. The main difference is that the
stimuli which reach sleeping consciousness from the
organs within the body&mdash;the stomach, heart, lungs,
sexual apparatus, bladder, etc.&mdash;are usually more vague
and massive, more difficult to recognise and identify,
than are the more specific sensory stimuli which reach
us from without. These visceral excitations may be
transformed within the brain into imagery so unlike
themselves that we may refuse to recognise them, and
must frequently experience some amount of hesitation.
Evidence of this fact will come before us in due course
later on. I only wish to refer here to the more obvious
part played in dreams by sensations arising within
the body.</p>

<p>We should expect that the visceral processes to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
translated most clearly and directly into dreaming
consciousness would be, not those which are regular
and continuous, but those which assert themselves,
more or less imperiously, at intervals. This is actually
the case. The heart, for instance, probably plays a
part in dreams only when disturbed in its action, and
even then nearly always a very transformed part. On
the other hand, when the impulses of the generative
system arise in sleep to manifest themselves in erotic
dreams, the resulting imagery is usually very clear, and
with very definite and recognisable sexual associations.
Erotic dreams are, indeed, in both men and women,
among the most vivid of all dreams, and the most
emotionally potent.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>The bladder, again, is an internal organ which makes
its functional needs felt only at intervals, and thus,
when those needs occur during sleep, they become
conscious in imagery which easily recalls the source
of the stimulus. It may, indeed, be said that vesical
dreams are full of instruction in the light they throw
on the psychology of dreaming. This has long been
well known to writers on dreams. Thus Scherner,
many years ago, insisted on the interest and importance
of vesical dreams. In women, especially, he regarded
them as very frequent and developed, most dream
stories of women, he considered, containing symbolic
representations of this organic irritation. Water, in
some form or another, is naturally the commonest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
symbol. In Scherner's opinion, also, all dreams of fish
playing in the water are vesical dreams.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>In its simplest form the vesical dream is what Freud
would term a wish-dream of infantile type, frequently
in the magnified form common in dreams, and sometimes
transferred from the dreamer himself to become
objectified in another person, or even an inanimate
object.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> There is, however, a very important difference
according to whether these dreams take place in an
adult or in a young child. In the adult it almost invariably
happens that the dream act remains merely
a dream act, and no corresponding motor impulse is
transmitted to the bladder. But when such dreams
occur to very young children, in whose brains the motor
inhibitory mechanism is not yet fully established, it
not infrequently happens that the motor impulse is
transmitted and the expulsive action of the bladder is
set up in sympathy with the imagery of the dream;
thus is established the condition known as nocturnal
enuresis. As the young brain develops, and inhibition
becomes more perfect, these vesical dreams cease to
exert any actual effect on the bladder, even when, as
sometimes happens, they continue to occur at intervals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
in adult life.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Occasionally, both in those who have
and those who have not suffered from nocturnal enuresis
in childhood (especially women), vesical dreams of this
character may occur without even any real distension
of the bladder. In some of these cases the dream can
be shown to be due to a reminiscence or suggestion from
the waking life of the previous day. Dreams stimulated
by organic sensations from within are thus found
to resemble those proceeding from sensory sensations
from without in that they are both exactly simulated
by dreams which are mainly of central origin.</p>

<p>When we turn to those internal organs of the body
which normally carry on their functions in a constant
and equable manner, seldom or never obtruding themselves
into the sphere of consciousness, any disturbance
of function seems much less likely to be translated into
dream consciousness in a simple and direct form. It is
sufficient to take the example of the heart. When the
heart is acting normally any consciousness of its action
is as rare asleep as awake. Even when cardiac action
is disturbed, either by disease or by temporary excitement,
dream consciousness seldom realises the
physical cause of the disturbance. Occasionally, indeed,
the cardiac disturbance may reach sleeping
consciousness without any very remote transformation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
thus a lady dreams that she is fainting while
really breathing in a slightly laboured and spasmodic
way; but at another period the same lady, at a time
when she was suffering from some degree of heart
weakness, dreamed one night, when the trouble was
specially marked, that she was driving sweating horses
up a steep hill, urging them on with the whip in order
to avoid an express train which she imagined was behind
her. This dream of sweating and panting horses
climbing a hill has been noted by various observers to
occur in connection with heart trouble.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> The real
difficulty of the panting and struggling heart instinctively
finds its apparent explanation in a familiar
spectacle of daily life.</p>

<p>In another case a dreamer awoke from a disturbed
sleep associated with indigestion, having the impression
that burglars were tramping upstairs, but immediately
realised that the tramp of the burglars' feet was really
the beating of her own heart. Somewhat similarly,
when suffering from headache, I have dreamed of
hammering nails into a floor, a theory obviously invented
to account for the thump of throbbing arteries.</p>

<p>An interesting group of phenomena connected with
the sensory influences discussed in this chapter is
furnished by the premonitions of physical disorders
and diseases sometimes experienced in dreams. A
physical disturbance may reach sleeping consciousness
many hours, or even days, before it is perceived by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
waking consciousness, and become translated into a
more or less fantastic dream. This has been recognised
from of old, and Aristotle, for instance, observed that
dreams magnify sensory excitations, and pointed out
that they were thus useful to the physician in diagnosing
symptoms not yet perceptible in the waking state.
Thus Hammond knew a gentleman who, before an
attack of hemiplegic paralysis, repeatedly dreamed
that he had been cut in two down the middle line, and
could only move on one side, while a young lady who
dreamed she had swallowed molten lead, though quite
well on awaking, was attacked by severe tonsilitis
toward midday. Erythematous conditions of the skin,
as has been pointed out to me by Dr. Kiernan, who has
met with numerous cases in point, play an especial
part in generating these dreams. Jewell, again, mentions
a girl who dreamed, three days before being
laid up with typhoid fever, that some one threw
oil over her and set light to it. Macario, who was,
perhaps, the first to record and study scientifically the
dreams of this class, termed them prodromic.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>'Prophetic' dreams, in which the dreamer foresees,
not a physical condition which is already latent, but an
external occurrence, belong to an entirely different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
class, and need not be discussed in detail here, since they
are usually fallacious. A fairly common experience
of this kind is the dream of an unknown person who is
afterwards met in real life. These dreams fall into two
groups: in the first the 'prophecy' is based on a
failure of memory, the dreamer having really seen the
person before; in the second, the subsequent 'recognition'
of the person is due to the emotional preparation
of the dream, and the concentrated expectation. Sante
de Sanctis, who points this out, gives an experience of
the kind which happened to the distinguished novelist,
Capuana, who had a vivid dream of a dark lady, with
expressive eyes, and three days after met the lady of
his dream in the street.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Women, in a state of emotional
expectation, have often mistaken dead (or even
living) persons for missing husbands or children, and
any one who has observed how, when a noted criminal
flies from justice, he is soon 'recognised,' from his
portrait, in the most various parts of the world, will
have no difficulty in believing that it is easily possible
to 'recognise' people from dream portraits, which are
much vaguer than photographs. That there are other
prophetic dreams, less easy to account for, I am ready
to admit, though they have not come under my own
immediate observation.</p>

<p>Whether the influences which stimulate our dreams
arise from without or from within the organism, they
are always filtered and diffused through the obscured
channels of perception. They reach the brain at last
in a vague and massive shape which may or may not
betray to waking analysis the source from which they
arise, but will certainly have become so changed in
these organic channels that their affective tone will
be predominant. They are, that is to say, largely
transformed into <em>emotion</em>. And, when so transformed,
they become the origin of what we regard as the imaginative
element in dreams.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Sleep is especially favourable to the production of
emotion because while it allows a considerable amount
of activity to sensory activities, and a very wide freedom
to the imagery founded on sensory activities, it largely
and in many directions inhibits motor activity.
The actions suggested by sensory excitation cannot,
therefore, be carried out. As soon as the impulse
enters motor channels it is impeded, broken up, and
scattered in a vain struggle. This process is transmitted
to the brain as a wave of emotion.</p>

<p>Sometimes, indeed, as we know, motor co-ordinations,
usually inhibited in sleep, are not so inhibited.
The dreamer is able to execute, perfectly or imperfectly,
some action which, really or in imagination, he desires
to execute. He is then said to be in a state of somnambulism.
The somnambulist, in the wide sense of the
word, is not necessarily a person who walks in his sleep,
but any person in whom a group of co-ordinated muscles
is sufficiently awake to respond more or less adequately
to the motor impulse from the sleeping brain. To talk
in sleep is a form of somnambulism. When the motor
channels are thus unimpeded, there is usually no
memory of a dream on awaking. The impulses that
reach consciousness can be, as it were, quickly and
easily drained off to the surface of the nervous system,
and they tend to leave no deep impress on consciousness.</p>

<p>'I worked late last night,' writes a lady, a novelist,
'went to bed, and dropped into a dead kind of sleep.
When I woke this morning about seven a funny thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
had happened. Two candles were burning in my room.
When I went to bed I had only one burning, and I know
I put that out. Now, there were two burning side by
side as if I had been writing, and they had evidently
been burning only an hour or so, I must have got up
and lighted them in my sleep.'<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> The actions carried
out in the somnambulistic condition are not usually
co-ordinated with the action of higher emotions: thus,
a young woman was impelled by a distended bladder,
while still asleep, to get out of bed and proceeded to
carry out the suggested action, but without further precautions,
on to the floor; she was only awakened by an
exclamation from her sister, who had been aroused by the
sound. We seem to see that under a strong stimulus&mdash;unfinished
work in one case, vesical tension in the other&mdash;the
motor centres have awakened to activity in the
early morning while the higher centres are still soundly
asleep. If the second sleeper had not been awakened,
in neither case would any memory of the incidents have
remained.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> There has been no struggle, and no resultant
emotions have, therefore, been aroused to
impress consciousness. It is evident that the lack of
adaptation between sensory and motor activity is an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
important factor in dreams, and contributes to impart
to them their emotional character.</p>

<p>In somnambulism we have a state which is in some
respects the reverse of that usual in dreams. The
higher centres are, indeed, split off from the lower
centres, but it is the former that are asleep and the
latter are awake, whereas in ordinary dreaming the
higher centres are acting in accordance with their
means, while the lower centres are quiescent. Somnambulism
is an approximation to a condition found
in some diseases of the brain when, as a result of lesion
of the higher nervous levels, we have a mental state&mdash;the
ideatory apraxia of Liepmann&mdash;in which the
muscular system carries out plans, but the plans are
defective because not supervised by the higher centres.
In ordinary dreams, on the other hand, we have a state
comparable to that produced by brain lesions in what
Pick terms motor apraxia, in which the higher centres
are acting freely, but their plans are never carried into
action owing to failure of the motor centres.</p>

<p>This characteristic of dreaming has seemed puzzling
to some writers. They ask why, in our dreams, we
should sometimes be so conscious of failure of movement,
and why, when we strive to move in dreams,
we do not always actually move.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>There scarcely seems to me to be any serious difficulty
here; still, the question is one of considerable
interest and importance. It is necessary to point out
in the first place that, however complete the actual
absence of movement, there is usually no failure of
movement in the dream vision. We dream that we are
talking, that we are moving from place to place, that
we are performing various actions. We are conscious
of no difficulty, even sometimes of a peculiar facility,
in executing these movements. And in normal persons,
under normal conditions, it would seem that the dream
movements take place without even an incipient degree
of corresponding actual movement perceptible to an
observer. The efferent motor channels, and even to a
large extent the afferent sensory channels, are asleep,
and the whole representative circuit is completed within
the brain, or, as we say, imaginatively.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Thus a
middle-aged friend, whose habits are by no means
athletic, dreams that, desiring to attract some one's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
attention, he rests one knee on his wife's small work-table,
and holding the foot of the other leg in one hand,
he whirls rapidly and easily round and round on the
pivot of the knee which rests on the table, the dream
afterwards continuing without any awakening. A lady,
again, who, when awake, is unable to swim, and knows
no reason why she should think of swimming, vividly
dreams that she jumps from a houseboat into the river,
and proceeds to swim on her side with great ease, this
dream also continuing without awakening. These
dreamers were able to execute triumphantly the muscular
feats they planned, because they had not really attempted
to execute them at all, and, moreover, no
sufficient sensory messages reached the brain to give
information that the limbs were not actually obeying
the orders of the brain. The dreamers were probably
in a somewhat deep state of sleep.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>The dreams in which we seem to ourselves to be
suffering from the difficulty or impossibility of movement
thus constitute a special class. Jewell would
apply to them the term 'nightmare,' which he regards
as 'characterised by inability to move or speak.' When,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
in dreams, we become conscious of difficult movement, it
has frequently, and perhaps usually, happened that the
motor channels are not entirely closed, the sensory
channels unusually open, and very frequently, though
not necessarily, this is associated with the approach of
awakening. I dreamed that I was walking with a
friend, that we quarrelled, and that thereupon I crossed
the road, and walked on ahead of him. These actions
seemed entirely effortless. Gradually, however, I became
conscious of immense and ineffectual effort in
keeping in front, and slowly began to experience, as I
awakened, a feeling of lassitude in my actual and
motionless limbs. In the process of awakening, I take
it, the increased, but still defective, efflux of sensation
from the legs, conveying the message of their real
position, entered into conflict with the dream imagery,
and produced a struggle in consciousness. It is by no
means necessary to assume that there was a complete
absence of sensory impressions from the legs during
the earlier part of the dream; on the contrary, it is
probable that the feeling of lassitude was itself the
cause of the dream, the idea of walking being a theory
to account for the lassitude; this seems more probable
than that the actual lassitude was caused by the mental
exertion in the dream.</p>

<p>In a dream which a friend tells me he has often had,
and always finds painful, he imagines he is climbing a
mountain, and at last reaches a point at which, notwithstanding
all his efforts, further progress is impossible.
It seems probable that this dream is also an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
example of the conflict due to the process of awakening.
In this case, however, the solution is complicated by
the fact that in earlier life the dreamer had really once
found himself in the situation he now only experiences
in dreams.</p>

<p>It is sometimes possible to prove, through the evidence
of a witness, that in our dreams of movements executed
with difficulty, we are really sufficiently awake on the
motor side to be making actual movements, though
these actual movements may only very roughly correspond
to the movements we imagine we are trying to
make. Very frequently, no doubt, dreams of difficult
movement co-exist with, or are caused by, some degree
of actual movement. In some such cases, indeed, the
slight and imperfect actual movement may, in dream
consciousness, be a complete and adequate movement.
In these cases the imperfect sensory messages
are not, it seems, sufficiently precise to reveal to
sleeping consciousness the imperfection of the motor
impulses.</p>

<p>Exactly the same thing occurs under the allied
conditions of anaesthesia produced by drugs. Thus,
on one occasion, when coming to consciousness after
the administration of nitrous oxide gas, I had the
sensation of crying out aloud, but in reality, as I was
informed by a friend at my side, I merely made a
slight guttural sound. In the same way we see sleeping
dogs making slight movements of all their paws in
succession, a faint and abortive movement of running,
which in the sleeping dog's consciousness may, doubtless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
be accompanied by the notion that he is dashing
across a field after a rabbit.</p>

<p>In these dreams of failure of movement, it seems to
me, the dream process, as the result of an approximation
to the waking state, has become mixed with actual
sensori-motor impulses, but the threshold of waking
life is still too far off for actual movements to be completely
and successfully accomplished, and in the case
of the limbs the eye cannot be used to guide movements
which the muscular and cutaneous sensations are still
too dead to guide. It is important to remember that
in waking life, under pathological conditions, we may
have a precisely similar state of things. In some states
of cerebro-spinal degeneration, resulting in defective
sensibility of muscle and nerve, the subject sways
unsteadily when he closes his eyes, and when there is
loss of sensibility in the arm it is sometimes impossible
to hold objects in the hand except with the guiding
aid afforded by the eye.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>In a dream, dating from fifteen years back, that I
now regard as conditioned by the approach of the
moment of awakening, I imagined that I was making
huge efforts to copy in a copy-book a capital H, engraved
in a rather peculiar fashion, but really offering
no difficulties to any waking schoolchild. By no means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
could I get the proportions right, if, indeed, I could
make any stroke at all, and at the end of my painful
and ineffectual efforts I seemed to be trying to write
on sand, which was merely displaced by my hand.
This final impression seems clearly to be that of a
dreamer who is already sufficiently awake to be conscious
of the bedclothes yielding to the touch.</p>

<p>The foregoing dream suggests that failure of movement
in dreaming may tend to be associated with an
accentuation of that shifting of imagery which is one
of the most primary elements in dreaming, both failure
of movement and accentuation of shifting imagery
being, perhaps, alike due to the approach towards the
waking state. Thus, if in a dream one is brushing
one's coat, one finds, without any overwhelming surprise,
that fresh patches of dust appear again and again,
even when one's efforts in brushing them away are
successful. Even when we feel able to effect movement
in our dream, there may still be a failure of that
movement to effect its object.</p>

<p>The question of movement in dreams, of the presence
or absence of effort and inhibition, is thus seen to be
explicable by reference to the depth of sleep and the
particular groups of centres involved. In full normal
sleep movements are purely ideatory, and no difficulty
arises in executing any movement, for the reason that
there really is no movement at all, or even any attempt
at movement, while, even if slight movement occurs,
no message of its actual defectiveness can reach the
brain. Movement or attempt at movement, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
more or less inhibition, tends to occur when the motor
and sensory centres are in a partially aroused state;
it is a phenomenon which belongs to the period immediately
before awakening.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>It is doubtless mainly due to the diffusion of inhibited
nervous impulses through many channels, and the
vague and massive character which they hence assume
in consciousness, that we must attribute the magnification
of dream imagery, and the exaggeration of dream
feelings. This is not a constant tendency of our dreams;
sometimes, indeed, perhaps in special stages of sleep-consciousness,
there is diminution, and people look no
larger than dolls, and houses like doll's houses, while,
on the emotional side, events which in real life would
overwhelm us, may, in dreams, be accepted as matters
of course. But the heightening of imagery and ideas
and feelings is very common. There is a kind of normal
megalomania in our dreams. We have already incidentally
encountered many instances of this: a tooth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
appears large enough for a mouse to play in, or like a
great jagged rock; the irritation of a mosquito evokes
the image of a huge scarlet beetle; in vesical dreams
endless streams are seen to flow; a canary's song is
heard as Haydn's <em>Creation</em>, and the howling of the
wind becomes a chanted Te Deum.</p>

<p>A French author has written an impressive literary
description of his own purely visual dreams, with their
magnificent exaggerations and joyous expansiveness,
seeking to show that their chief character is their
excessiveness; 'the flowers are almost women.'<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> I
cannot, however, recognise this as characteristic of
normal dreaming. It bears more resemblance to De
Quincey's opium dreams, or to the visions which came
to Heine as he listened to Berlioz's music. In normal
dreaming the imagery may, indeed, be stupendously
vast, or fantastically absurd, or poignantly intense.
But normal dreams are not built on a consistently
colossal scale. The megalomania of dreaming is only
accidental and occasional, not systematic.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>The heightening of dream experiences may, however,
be very complete in, as it were, every direction: thus
a botanical friend joined a large party for a pleasant
country excursion, in the course of which, while sitting
in a waggonette, an acquaintance, a miller, standing in
the road, handed up to him a dog-rose. In the course of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
a dream of agreeable emotional tone on the night
following, this incident was reproduced, but the miller
had become an angel, who handed down to him, instead
of up from below, a flower which was a moss-rose.</p>

<p>Thus, not only do the actual stimuli taking place
during sleep suggest to dream-consciousness imagery
of a magnitude out of all proportion to their real intensity,
but even the repercussion of the day's incidents
in dreams under the influence of a favourable emotional
tone may partake of the same heightening influence.</p>

<p>We may say, therefore, that while the excessiveness
of dream imagery is mainly due to the conditions of the
nervous sensory and motor channels, there is also
probably a heightened affectability of the cerebral
centres themselves&mdash;perhaps due to their state of
dissociation or absence of apperception<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>&mdash;which leads
us in our dreams to react extravagantly to the stimuli
that reach the brain. A lady tells me that she often
dreams of being very angry at things which, on awaking,
she finds are mere trifles that would never make her
angry when awake.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> It is a common experience that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>the things which, in our dreams, impress us as beautiful,
eloquent, witty, profound, or amusing, no longer seem
so, or only seem so in a much slighter degree, when we
are able to recall them awake.</p>

<p>All these various considerations lead us up to a central
fact in the psychology of dreaming: the controlling
power of emotion on dream ideas. From our present
point of view we are now able to say that the chief
function of dreams is to supply adequate theories to
account for the magnified emotional impulses which
are borne in on sleeping consciousness. This is the key
to imagination in dreams. From the first we have seen
that in dream life the mind is always freely and actively
reasoning; we now see what is usually the real motive
and aim of that reasoning. Sleeping consciousness
is assailed by waves of emotion from various parts of
the organism, but is entirely unable to detect their
origin, and, therefore, invents an explanation of them.
So that in sleep we have to weave theories concerning
the unknowable origin of our emotions, just as when
we are awake we weave theories concerning the
ultimate origin of the totality of our experiences. The
fundamental source of our dream life may thus be
said to be emotion.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>There is certainly no profounder emotional excitement
during sleep than that which arises from a disturbed
or distended stomach, and is reflected by the
pneumogastric to the accelerated heart and the excited
respiration.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> We are thereby thrown into a state of
emotional agitation, a state of agony and terror, such as
we rarely or never attain during waking life. Sleeping
consciousness, blindfolded and blundering, a prey to
these massive waves from below, and fumbling about
desperately for some explanation, jumps at the idea
that only the attempt to escape some terrible danger
or the guilty consciousness of some awful crime can
account for this immense emotional uproar. Thus the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
dream is suffused by a conviction which the continued
emotion serves to support. We do not&mdash;it seems most
simple and reasonable to conclude&mdash;experience terror
because we think we have committed a crime, but we
think we have committed a crime because we experience
terror. And the fact that in such dreams we are far
more concerned with escape from the results of crime
than with any agony of remorse is not, as some have
thought, due to our innate indifference to crime, but
simply to the fact that our emotional state suggests to
us active escape from danger rather than the more
passive grief of remorse. Thus our dreams bear
witness to the fact that our intelligence is often but a
tool in the hands of our emotions.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>In this tendency, it may be noted, we see the basis
of the symbolism which plays so real a part in dreams.
Such symbolism rests on the fact that we associate two
things&mdash;even if the one happens to be physical and the
other spiritual&mdash;which both happen to imply a similar
state of feeling.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Symbolism of this kind is, indeed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>characteristic of the human mind at all times, in all
stages of its development. Thus the physical idea of
<em>height</em> seems to express also a moral idea, which we feel
to be correspondent, while wormwood and gall furnish
a taste which enabled men to speak of what seemed to
them the corresponding <em>bitterness</em> of death. In dreams
this natural tendency of the mind is able to work unchecked
and extravagantly. It acts with much facility
on any impulse arising from the gastric region, because
this region is the seat of various sensations and emotions,
both physical and moral, which may thus act symbolically
the one for the other.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>Even when we realise the process of transformation
and irradiation, through which organic sensations can
alone reach the brain in sleep, and the inevitable 'errors
of judgment' thus produced, it may still seem strange
and puzzling to observe how a stimulus which has its
origin in the stomach will, by affecting the neighbouring
viscera, in its circuitous course along the nerves and
through the brain, be transformed, as it may be, into a
tragic scene which has never been experienced, nor even
deliberately imagined, as for instance&mdash;to cite a dream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
of my own&mdash;in the fiery vision of following a leader, in
real life a peaceful and inoffensive man, who, revolver
in hand, dashes among foes, shooting and shot at,
every moment in danger of life, and always miraculously
escaping.</p>

<p>I may illustrate this transformation by the following
example: A lady dreamed that her husband called her
aside and said, 'Now, do not scream or make a fuss;
I am going to tell you something. I have to kill a man.
It is necessary, to put him out of his agony.' He then
took her into his study, and showed her a young man
lying on the floor, with a wound in his breast, and covered
with blood. 'But how will you do it?' she asked.
'Never mind,' he replied; 'leave that to me.' He
took something up and leaned over the man. She
turned aside and heard a horrible gurgling sound.
Then all was over. 'Now,' he said, 'we must get rid
of the body. I want you to send for So-and-so's cart,
and tell him I wish to drive it.' The cart came. 'You
must help me to make the body into a parcel,' he said
to his wife; 'give me plenty of brown paper.' They
made it into a parcel, and with terrible difficulty and
effort the wife assisted her husband to get the body
downstairs, and lift it into the cart. At every stage,
however, she presented to him the difficulties of the
situation. But he carelessly answered all objections,
said he would take the body up to the moor, among the
stones, remove the brown paper, and people would think
the murdered man had killed himself. He drove off,
and soon returned with the empty cart. 'What's this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
blood in my cart?' asked the man to whom it belonged,
looking inside. 'Oh, that's only paint,' replied the
husband. But the dreamer had all along been full of
apprehensions lest the deed should be discovered, and
the last thing she could recall, before waking in terror,
was looking out of the window at a large crowd which
surrounded the house with shouts of 'Murder!' and
threats.</p>

<p>This tragedy, with its almost Elizabethan air, was
built up out of a few commonplace impressions received
during the previous day, none of which impressions
contained any suggestion of murder. The tragic element
appears to have been altogether due to the psychic
influences of indigestion arising from a supper of
pheasant.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> To account for our oppression during
sleep, sleeping consciousness assumes moral causes,
which alone appear to it of sufficient gravity to be
adequate to the immense emotions we are experiencing.
Even in our waking and fully conscious states we are
inclined to give the preference to moral over physical
causes, quite irrespective of the justice of our preferences;
in our sleeping states this tendency is exaggerated,
and the reign of purely moral causes is not often
disturbed by even a suggestion of physical causation.</p>

<p>In an emotional dream of similar visceral origin, I
dreamed that I was to die&mdash;why or how I could not tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
on awakening. With the object of putting an end to
my sufferings, I imagined that my wife administered to
me some substance mixed in jam. I found the taste
peculiar, not bitter, as I recalled on awaking, but warm
and spicy, and I asked what she had put in it. She
replied that it was strychnine. I remarked that that
would be a very painful mode of death, and refused to
take any more. I debated with myself whether I had
probably taken a poisonous dose, and had not better
resort to an antidote; the only antidote that suggested
itself to me was opium pills. Meanwhile the horror
of impending death grew more and more acute until,
at length, I awoke. I thereupon found that I had a
headache, a faint taste in my mouth, and some general
malaise evidently associated with a slightly disordered
stomach. The definite images brought forward in the
dream had all been fairly familiar during the previous
day, but the idea of impending death which pervaded
the whole dream so indefinitely and incoherently, yet
so acutely, was entirely a theory to account for the
massive and widely irradiated messages of discomfort
which reached the sleeping brain.</p>

<p>Many people are unwilling to admit that psychic
phenomena so tragical, poignant, or pathetic as these
dreams may be, should receive their stimulus from a
source which they regard as so humble as the stomach.
Thus Frederick Greenwood, whose conception of the
function of dreaming was very exalted, only admitted
this association with reluctance, and was careful to
point out that 'if an unwholesome supper produces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
such phenomena, it does so only in the sense that a
bird singing in the air produced Shelley's "Ode to a
Skylark."'<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> That analogy really underestimates the
distance of the physical stimulus of such dreams from
its psychic concomitants. When we talk of dreams
we must place ourselves at the dreamer's standpoint.
The poet was conscious that his inspiration was stimulated
by the bird's song, but the dreamer has no
consciousness that the tragic experiences he passes
through imaginatively are stimulated by the activity
of his visceral organs. He is altogether unconscious of
visceral disturbance; if he were conscious of any of
these physical facts which occupy waking consciousness,
he would no longer be a dreamer. He lives in a psychic
world which physical facts, from within or from without,
can never reach until they have been transformed.
His position resembles, therefore, not that of the poet
who deliberately seeks to interpret the song of the
bird, but rather that of the bird itself, the poet 'hidden
in the light of thought,' sublimely unconscious of the
mechanism revealed in its own structure.</p>

<p>The explanations devised by sleeping consciousness
to account for visceral discomfort of gastric origin are
not necessarily tragic. Thus I dreamed, after a somewhat
indigestible meal, that I was slowly and painfully
eating bread mingled with cinders and mouse's excrement,
trying in vain to avoid these impurities, and
after the meal was over, finding my mouth full of cinders.
On awaking there was no traceable taste or sensation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
of any kind in the mouth, and the dream was apparently
a theory to account for some gastric disturbance.
Such a theory seems less far-fetched than that of
murder, and probably indicates much less marked and
diffused visceral disturbance. Occasionally the explanatory
theories of actual sensations accepted by sleeping
consciousness are plausible and ingenious, indeed entirely
adequate and probable. Thus a lady dreamed
that she was drinking glass after glass of champagne,
saying to herself the while that she would have to pay
for this afterwards. On awaking she found that she
was feeling the slight rheumatic pains and discomfort
that she was really liable to experience after taking a
glass or two of champagne. She had not tasted champagne,
or thought of it, for some time previously; the
dream champagne was a theory invented to account
for the sensations which were actually experienced,
though those sensations remained outside dreaming
consciousness.</p>

<p>Most of the examples I have presented of the influence
of emotion of visceral origin in suggesting dream
theories have had the stomach as their source. There
can be no doubt that the stomach has enormous influence
in this respect; its easily and constantly varying
state of repletion, its central position and liability to
press on other organs, its important nervous associations,
together with the fact that sleep sometimes
tends to impede its activity and initiate disturbance,
combine to impart to it a manifold and extensive
influence over the emotional state in sleep, and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the same time render the source of that emotional
state peculiarly difficult for sleeping consciousness to
detect.</p>

<p>It is, however, easy to show that any pronounced or
massive feeling continuing or arising during sleep may
similarly lead to an emotional state calling for explanation
at the hands of sleeping consciousness. Thus,
falling asleep with toothache during a singularly close
night, I once dreamed that I had committed murder,
having apparently killed several persons, and that I was
occupied, after arrest, in considering whether my act
was likely to be regarded as an unpremeditated act of
manslaughter. A headache, again, may be a source
of dreams. Thus, falling asleep with headache, I
dream that I am waiting for an express train to London;
an express comes up to the platform, and I cannot ascertain
if it is the train I want. The explanation seems
obvious; railway travelling is a cause of headache,
and it is therefore put forward in the dream, with
accompanying imagery, to account for the sensations
experienced. The actual sensation, as is always the
case in dreams, that is, the headache, remains subconscious,
and, indeed, totally unconscious; the imagery
it suggests alone occupies the field of consciousness.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
An entirely different type of dream may, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
be associated with headache. Thus I once dreamed
that I was in a vast gloomy English cathedral, and on
the wall I observed a notice to the effect that on
such a day evensong would take place without illumination
of the cathedral in order to avoid attracting moths.
I awoke with slight headache. Here the cool, silent
gloom of the cathedral is the symbol of what is desired
to soothe the aching head, and the fantastic suggestion
read on the notice is merely the theory of dreaming
consciousness which knows nothing of the real reason
of the wish.</p>

<p>Dreams of murder or impending death or the like
tragic situations seem usually to be aroused by visceral
stimuli. In some cases, however (as in Maury's famous
dream of the guillotine), they are due to an external
cutaneous sensation. When the stimulus thus comes
from the periphery, the emotional element, even when
the dreamed situation is tragic, seems usually (though
this is not quite certain) to be less pronounced than when
the stimulus is visceral. Thus in a dream of my own,
which seemed to be due to a cramped position of the head
and neck, I dreamed that I had died (though, somehow,
I was not myself, but had become more or less identified
with an ugly old woman), and was being autopsied.
Then very gradually I became faintly and peacefully
conscious of what was going on, though I remained
motionless, and all the time believed that I was dead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
and that my faint consciousness was merely a part of
death. Preparations for the funeral were meanwhile
being made, and I was about to be nailed down in my
coffin. At this point I became horribly aware that
these proceedings would cause suffocation, and, with
great effort, I succeeded in moving my arms and speaking
incoherently. Thereupon the funeral arrangements
were discontinued, and very slowly I seemed to regain
speech and the power of movement. But I felt that I
must be extremely careful in making any movements,
on account of the post-mortem wounds; especially
I felt pain in my neck, and realised that it was necessary
not to move my head, or the result might be instant
death. In such a dream, it may be noted, and in some
others I have recorded, we see very instructively the
nature of the changes produced in the dream and in the
dreamer's attitude by the approach of waking consciousness.
The dreamer's relationship to his imagined
situation becomes more and more what it would be if
the situation occurred in real life, and as soon as there is
painful effort and imperfect muscular movement, the
coming of waking consciousness is imminent.</p>

<p>The visceral and emotional element in dreaming
helps to explain the dreamer's moral attitude and the
real significance of those criminal actions in dreams
which have often been misinterpreted. Many writers
on dreaming have referred, with profound concern, to
the facility and prevalence of murder in dreams, sometimes
as a proof of the innate wickedness of human
nature made manifest in the unconstraint of sleep,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
sometimes as evidence of an atavistic return to the modes
of feeling of our ancestors, the thin veneer of civilisation
being removed during sleep. Maudsley and Mme.
de Manac&eacute;&iuml;ne, for example, find evidence in such dreams
of a return to primitive modes of feeling. Clarke
speaks of 'the entire absence of the moral sense' from
dreams.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> Professor N&auml;cke, who has given much attention
to the phenomena of dreaming, writes in a private
letter: 'What I am amazed at, having perceived it in
myself, is the little known fact that a person's character
becomes <em>worse</em> in dreaming. Not only the most
secret thoughts, wishes, and aspirations become clear,
but also qualities which have never been observed
before, as, for instance, that one becomes a murderer,
an adulterer, etc.' Freud, especially, has elaborated
this aspect of dreams as representing the fulfilment of
the dreamer's most secret desires.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>It may well be that there is an element of truth in
the belief that in dreams we are brought back to mental
conditions somewhat more closely approaching those of
primitive times. It is the manifold variety and complexity
of our mental representations which prevent us
from responding immediately to impulse under civilised
conditions, and when, by dissociation, only a few
groups are present to consciousness, the inhibition on
violent action tends to be removed. If, therefore, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
are more violent, more immoral, more criminal, in our
dreams than in waking life, this is by no means necessarily
to be regarded as a revelation of our real nature,
but is merely an inevitable result of the mental dissociation
which prevents many important groups of
mental representations from finding their way into consciousness,
and at the same time brings all our mental
possessions on to the same plane, so that the things
we have merely thought or heard of have the same
visual reality as our own actual experiences. The sleep
of the real criminal, as Sante de Sanctis has shown on
the basis of a wide experience, even of criminals guilty
of serious acts of violence, tends to be peaceful and
dreamless, and such dreams as they have are usually
of a simple and innocent sort. If normal people often
dream of crime, it is because they are more sensitive
and imaginative, and because sleeping consciousness is
strained to the utmost to invent a phantasmal tragedy
adequate to account for the waves of emotion that
beset it.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>There is another reason why, in dreams, we may find
ourselves engaged in criminal operations. The purely
automatic process by which the imagery of dreams is
perpetually shifting in pursuit of associations of resemblance
or contiguity, leads to confusions which are not
rooted in any personal or primitive impulse, as in the
example I have previously referred to, of a lady who had
carved a duck at dinner, and a few hours later woke up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
exhausted by the imaginary effort of cutting off her
husband's head. Such a dream is merely a mechanical
turn of the visionary kaleidoscope, bringing together
two unrelated images.</p>

<p>The most potent cause of dream criminality, and
especially of murders we have been guilty of before the
dream commenced, seems clearly, however, to be that
emotional factor of visceral origin which is well illustrated
by one or two of the dreams already brought
forward.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> In these cases, again, we are not concerned
with any primitive or personal impulse to crime, but
we feel ourselves to be so possessed by all the physical
symptoms of terror, that the only adequate explanation
of our state seems to be the theory that we have committed
murder. And if we are more concerned to flee
from justice than to experience remorse, that is clearly
because the really labouring and agitated heart suggests
flight from pursuit far more than any passive emotion.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
There is, moreover, no more fundamental and primitive
emotion than fear.</p>

<p>While these considerations combine to deprive criminal
dreams, when they occur, of any great significance
as an index of the dreamer's latent morality, I must
add that I am by no means prepared to agree that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
moral emotions are so absent from sleep as many
writers have stated. There is often a diminished sense
of morality, an easier yielding to temptation than would
take place in real life, a diminished remorse&mdash;these
tendencies being mainly due to the conditions of dream-life&mdash;but
there is frequently a strong sense of morality
in dreams, as well as a vivid perception of social proprieties.
Those persons who have an unusually strong
moral sense, when awake, frequently show, I think, a
similar tendency when asleep, but in the dreams of most
people moral and decorous considerations seem, as a rule,
to make themselves more or less clearly felt, much as
in waking life. It may be worth while to bring forward
a few dreams which incidentally illustrate the moral
attitude of the dreamer.</p>

<p>A lady narrated the following dream immediately
on awakening: 'I had murdered a woman from some
moral or political motive&mdash;I forget what&mdash;and had come
in great agony to my husband with her shoes and
watch-chain. He promised to help me, and while I
was wondering what could be done for the benefit of
the woman's family, some one came in and announced
that a lecture was about to be given on the beauty of
nakedness. I then went, with several prim and respectable
ladies of my acquaintance [the names were
given], into a crowded hall. The lecturer who&mdash;so far
as appearance is concerned&mdash;was a well-known Member
of Parliament, then entered and gave a most eloquent
address on Whitman, nakedness, ugly figures, etc.
He especially emphasised the fact that the reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
people are shocked at nakedness is that they usually
only see unbeautiful bodies which repel them because
they are unlike their ideals. Then he put out his hand,
and a naked woman entered the room. Her loveliness
was extreme; her form was perfectly rounded, but
without suggestion of voluptuousness, though she was
not an animated statue, but had all the characters of
humanity; she walked with undulating thighs, head
slightly drooping, and hair falling down and framing a
face that expressed wonderful spiritual beauty and innocence.
The lecturer led her round, saying, "This is
beauty; now, if you can look at this and be ashamed&mdash;&mdash;"
and he waved his arm. She went away, and a beautiful
Apollo-like youth, slender but athletic, entered the
room, also completely naked. He walked round the
room alone, with an air of majestic virility. I applauded,
clapping my hands, but a shiver went through
the ladies present; their skin became like goose-flesh,
and their lips quivered with horror as though they were
about to be outraged. The youth went out, and the
lecturer continued. At the climax of his oratory, the
Apollo-like youth entered, dressed as a common soldier,
with no appearance of beauty, and in a rough tone said:
"'Ere! I want a shilling for this job." (And I sighed
to myself: "It is always so.") No one had a shilling,
and the lecturer proceeded to explain to the man that
what he had done was for the sake of art and beauty,
and for the moral good of the world. "What do I
care for that?" he returned, "I want a drink." Then a
lady among the audience produced a collar, wrote on it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
a testimonial expressing the gratitude of those present
for the man's services on this occasion, and handed it to
me to present to him. "Damn it," he said, "this is
only worth twopence halfpenny; I want my shilling!"
Then I awoke.' The idea of murder with which this
dream began seems to suggest that it may have had its
origin in some slight visceral disturbance of which the
subject was unconscious, but nothing had occurred to
suggest the details of the episode. The interesting
feature about it is the presence throughout of moral
notions and sentiments substantially true to the
dreamer's waking ideas.</p>

<p>In another dream of the same dreamer's the sense
of responsibility is clearly present: 'Mrs. F. and
Miss R. had called to see me, and I was sitting in my
room talking to them, when a knock came at the door,
and I found there a poor woman belonging to the neighbourhood,
but who also combined in my dream the
page-boy at a dear friend's house. From this friend,
whom I had not heard from for some time, the woman
bore a large letter. She tore it open in my presence,
saying, "It says here that the bearer is to open this,"
and produced from it another letter, a large document
of a legal character in my friend's handwriting.
When the woman began to open the second letter I
remonstrated; I was sure that there was some mistake,
that that letter was private, and that no one else ought
to see it. The woman, however, firmly insisted that
she must carry out her instructions; so we had a long
discussion. After a time I called Mrs. F. and appealed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
to her. She agreed with me that the instructions must
only mean that the bearer was to open the outer envelope,
not the inner letter. At last I took out five
shillings and gave it to the woman, telling her that I
would assume all the responsibility for opening the
letter myself. With this she went away well satisfied,
saying (as she would in real life), "All right, Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;,
you're a lady, and you know. All right, my dear."
Then at last I was able to tear open my letter and read
these words: "<cite>Always use Sunlight Soap</cite>." My vexation
was extreme.'</p>

<p>On another occasion the same dreamer experienced
remorse. She imagined she was in a restaurant, and
the girl behind the counter pointed to a barrel of beer&mdash;a
golden barrel, she said, with a magic key&mdash;which
could only be opened by the owner. The dreamer
declared, however, that she could open it, and, producing
a key, proceeded to do so, handing round beer to
the bystanders. Then she realised that she had been
stealing, and was full of remorse. She asked a friend
if she ought to tell the owner, but the friend replied,
'By no means.' This conclusion of the dream seems
to indicate that the moral sense, though present in
dreams, is apt to be impaired.</p>

<p>In yet another dream this dreamer exhibited a curious
combination of moral sensibility and criminal indifference.
She imagined that, while walking with a man,
a friend, she revealed to him a secret of a woman friend's.
Then, realising her betrayal of confidence, she decided
that the best thing she could do would be to kill the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
man. On reflection, however, she thought that it would,
after all, be unkind to do so since he was a friend, and
so told him that if he ever repeated the secret she would
have him torn to pieces. It will be seen that the betrayal
of a secret was felt as a far more serious offence
than murder. The facility with which, in such dreams
as this, the suggestion of murder presents itself, even to
dreamers who, when awake, cherish no bloodthirsty
or revengeful ideas, is certainly remarkable.</p>

<p>It is often said that in dreams erotic suggestions
present themselves with extreme facility, and are
eagerly accepted by the dreamer. To some extent
there is truth in this statement, but it is by no means
always true. This may be illustrated by the following
dream, the sources of which could be easily traced;
two days before I had seen the gambols of East Enders
at Hampstead Heath on a Bank Holiday, and the day
before I had visited a picture gallery, the two sets of
impressions becoming ingeniously combined, according
to the usual rule of dream confusion. I thought that
when walking along a country lane a sudden turn brought
me to a broader part of the road covered with grass, into
the midst of a crowd of women, large and well-proportioned
persons, mostly in a state of complete nudity,
and engaged in romping together, more especially in
tugs-of-war; some of them were on horseback. My
appearance slightly disturbed them, I heard one cry
out my name, and to some extent they drew back, and
partly desisted from their games, but only to a very
slight degree, and with no overpowering embarrassment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
I was myself rather embarrassed, and, glancing
at them again, turned back. Afterwards my walk
again brought me in view of them, and it occurred to
me that women are somewhat changing their customs,
a very wholesome change, it seemed to me. But I
remonstrated with one or two of them that they ought to
keep in constant movement to avoid catching cold.
No erotic suggestions were present, although the dream
might be said to lend itself to such suggestions.</p>

<p>The idea of moral retribution and eternal punishment
may also be present in dreams. This may be illustrated
by the dream of a lady who had an ill and restless girl
companion sleeping with her, and was disturbed as well
by a yelping and howling terrier outside. She had also
lately heard that a friend had brought over a python
from Africa. 'I dreamed last night I had a basket of
cold squirming snakes beside me; they just touched
me all over, but did not hurt; I felt mad with loathing
and hate of them, and the beasts would not kill
me. That, I thought, was my eternal punishment
for my sins.' In her waking moments the dreamer
was not apprehensive of eternal punishment, and it
may be in such a case that, as Freud suggests, an
unfamiliar moral idea emerges in sleep in much the
same way as an unfamiliar or 'forgotten' fact may
emerge.</p>

<p>On the whole, it may be said that while the moral
attitude of the dreaming state is not usually identical
with that of the waking state, there still nearly always
is a moral attitude. It could not well be otherwise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Our emotional states are intimately bound up with
moral relationships; we could not display such highly
emotional states as we experience in dreams, with all
their tragic accompaniments, in the absence of any
sense of morality.</p>

<p class="p6">AVIATION IN DREAMS</p>

<p>Dreams of Flying and Falling&mdash;Their Peculiar Vividness&mdash;Dreams
of Flying an Alleged Survival of Primeval Experiences&mdash;Best

Cutaneous Anaesthesia&mdash;The Explanation of Dreams of Falling&mdash;The
Sensation of Levitation sometimes experienced by Ecstatic
Saints&mdash;Also experienced at the Moment of Death.</p></blockquote>


<p>Dreams of flying, with the dreams of falling they are
sometimes associated with, may fairly be considered
the best known and most frequent type of dream.
They were among the earliest dreams to attract attention.
Ruths argues that the Greek conception of the
flying Hermes, the god who possessed special authority
over dreams, was based on such experiences. Lucretius,
in his interesting passage on the psychology of dreaming,
speaks of falling from heights in dreams;<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Cicero
appears to refer to dreams of flying; St. Jerome
mentions that he was subject to them; Synesius remarked
that in dreams we fly with wings and view the
world from afar; Cervantes accurately described the
dream of falling.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> From the inventors of the legend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
of Icarus onwards, men have firmly cherished the belief
that under some circumstances they could fly, and we
may well suppose that that belief partly owes its conviction,
and the resolve to make it practical, to the
experiences that have been gained in dreams.</p>

<p>No dreams, indeed, are so vivid and so convincing
as dreams of flying; none leave behind them so strong
a sense of the reality of the experience. Raffaelli,
the eminent French painter, who is subject to the
dreaming experience of floating in the air, confesses
that it is so convincing that he has jumped out of bed
on awaking and attempted to repeat it. 'I need not
tell you,' he adds, 'that I have never been able to
succeed.'<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Herbert Spencer mentions that in a company
of a dozen persons, three testified that in early
life they had had such vivid dreams of flying downstairs,
and were so strongly impressed by the reality
of the experience, that they actually made the attempt,
one of them suffering in consequence from an injured
ankle.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> The case is recorded of an old French lady
who always maintained that on one occasion she actually
had succeeded for a few instants in supporting herself
on the air.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> No one who is familiar with these dreaming
experiences will be inclined to laugh at that old lady.
It was during one of these dreams of levitation, in which
one finds oneself leaping into the air and able to stay
there, that it occurred to me that I would write a paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
on the subject, for I thought in my dream that
this power I found myself possessed of was probably
much more widespread than was commonly
supposed, and that in any case it ought to be generally
known.</p>

<p>People who dabble in the occult have been so impressed
by such dreams that they have sometimes
believed that these flights represented a real excursion
of the 'astral body.' This is the belief of Colonel
de Rochas.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> C&eacute;sar de Vesme, the editor of the French
edition of the <cite>Annals of Psychical Research</cite>, has thought
it worth while to investigate the matter; and after
summarising the results of a <em>questionnaire</em> concerning
dreams of flying, he comes to the conclusion that 'the
sensation of aerial flight in dreams is simply a hallucinatory
phenomenon of an exclusively physiological [he
means 'psychological'] kind,' and not evidence of the
existence of the 'astral body.'<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> The fact, nevertheless,
that so many people are found who believe such
dreams to possess some kind of reality, clearly indicates
the powerful impression they make.</p>

<p>All my life, it seems to me, certainly from an early
age, until recently, I have at intervals had dreams in
which I imagined myself rhythmically bounding into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the air, and supported on the air, remaining there for a
perceptible interval; at other times I have felt myself
gliding downstairs, but not supported by the stairs.
In my case the experience is nearly always agreeable,
involving a certain sense of power, and it usually
evokes no marked surprise, occurring as a familiar and
accustomed pleasure. On awaking I do not usually
remember these dreams immediately, which seems to
indicate that they are not due to causes specially
operative at the end of sleep, or liable to bring sleep to a
conclusion. But they leave behind them a vague yet
profound sense of belief in their reality and reasonableness.</p>

<p>Dream-flight, it is necessary to note, is not usually
the sustained flight of a bird or an insect, and the
dreamer rarely or never imagines that he is borne high
into the air. Hutchinson states that of all those whom
he has asked about the matter 'hardly one has ever
known himself to make any high flights in his dreams.
One almost always flies low, with a skimming manner,
slightly, but only slightly, above the heads of pedestrians.'<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>Beaunis, from his own experience, describes what I
should consider a typical kind of dream-flight as a series
of light bounds, at one or two yards above the earth,
each bound clearing from ten to twenty yards, the
dream being accompanied by a delicious sensation of
easy movement, as well as a lively satisfaction at
being able to solve the problem of aerial locomotion by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
virtue of superior organisation alone.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Lafcadio Hearn,
somewhat similarly, describes, in his <em>Shadowings</em>, a
typical and frequent dream of his own as a series of
bounds in long parabolic curves, rising to a height of
some twenty-five feet, and always accompanied by the
sense that a new power had been revealed which for the
future would be a permanent possession.</p>

<p>The attempt to explain dreams of flying has led to
some bold hypotheses. Freud characteristically affirms
that the dream of flying is the bridge to a concealed
wish.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> I have already mentioned the notion that
dreams of flight are excursions of the 'astral body.'
Professor Stanley Hall, who has himself, from childhood,
had dreams of flying, argues, with scarcely less
boldness, that we have here 'some faint reminiscent
atavistic echo from the primeval sea'; and that such
dreams are really survivals&mdash;psychic vestigial remains
comparable to the rudimentary gill-slits not uncommonly
found in man and other mammals&mdash;taking us back to
the far past when man's ancestors needed no feet to
swim or float.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> Such a theory may accord with the
profound conviction of reality that accompanies these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
dreams, though that may be more easily accounted for;
but it has the very serious weakness that it offers an
explanation which will not fit the facts. Our dreams
are of flying, not of swimming; but the ancestors of
the mammals probably lived in the water, not in the
air. In preference to so hazardous a theory, it seems
infinitely more reasonable to regard these dreams as
an interpretation&mdash;a misinterpretation from the standpoint
of waking life&mdash;of actual internal sensations.
If we can find the adequate explanation of a psychic
state in conditions actually existing within the organism
itself at the time, it is needless to seek an explanation
in conditions that ceased to exist untold millenniums
ago.</p>

<p>My own explanation was immediately suggested by
the following dream. I dreamed that I was watching
a girl acrobat, in appropriate costume, who was rhythmically
rising to a great height in the air and then falling,
without touching the floor, though each time she approached
quite close to it. At last she ceased, exhausted
and perspiring, and I had to lead her away. Her movements
were not controlled by mechanism, and apparently
I did not regard mechanism as necessary. It was
a vivid dream, and I awoke with a distinct sensation of
oppression in the chest. In trying to account for this
dream, which was not founded on any memory, it
occurred to me that probably I had here the key to a
great group of dreams. The rhythmic rising and
falling of the acrobat was simply the objectivation of
the rhythmic rising and falling of my own respiratory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
muscles&mdash;in some dreams, perhaps, of the systole and
diastole of the heart's muscles&mdash;under the influence of
some slight and unknown physical oppression, and this
oppression was further translated into a condition of
perspiring exhaustion in the girl, just as men with heart
disease may dream of sweating and panting horses
climbing uphill, in accordance with that tendency to
magnification which marks dreams generally.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> We
may recall also the curious sensation as of the body
being transformed into a vast bellows or steam engine,
which is often the last sensation felt before the unconsciousness
produced by nitrous oxide gas.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> When
we are lying down there is a real rhythmic rising and
falling of the chest and abdomen, centring in the
diaphragm, a series of oscillations which at both extremes
are only limited by the air. Moreover, in this
position we have to recognise that the circulatory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
nervous, and other systems of the whole internal
organism, are differently balanced from what they are
in the upright position, and that a disturbance of internal
equilibrium always accompanies falling.</p>

<p>It is also noteworthy (as, indeed, Wundt has briefly
remarked) that the modifications produced by sleep
in the respiratory process itself tend to facilitate its
interpretation as a process of flying. Mosso showed that
respiration in sleep is more thoracic than when awake,
that it is lengthened, and that the respiratory pause is
less marked.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> That is to say that both the aerial
element and the actual rhythmic movement of the ribs
become accentuated during sleep.</p>

<p>That the respiratory element is the chief factor in
dreams of flying is clearly indicated by the fact that
many persons subject to such dreams are conscious on
awaking from them of a sense of respiratory or cardiac
disturbance. I am acquainted with a psychologist who,
though not a frequent dreamer, is subject to dreams
of flying, which do not affect him disagreeably, but on
awaking from them he always perceives a slight flutter
of the heart. Any such sensation is by no means constant
with me, but I have occasionally noted it down
in exactly the same words after this kind of dream.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
It is worth while to observe, in this connection, how
large a number of people, and especially very young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
people, associate their dreams of flying with staircases.
The most frequent cause of cardiac and respiratory
stimulation, especially in children, who constantly run
up and down them, is furnished by staircases, and
though in health this fact may not be obvious, it is
undoubtedly registered unconsciously, and may thus
be utilised by dreaming intelligence.</p>

<p>There is, however, another element entering into the
problem of nocturnal aviation: the state of the skin
sensations. Respiratory activity alone would scarcely
suffice to produce the imagery of flight if sensations
of tactile pressure remained to suggest contact with
the earth. In dreams, however, the sense of movement
suggested by respiratory activity is unaccompanied
by the tactile pressure produced by boots or the contact
of the ground with the soles of the feet. In addition,
also, there is probably, as Bergson also has suggested,
a numbness due to pressure on the parts supporting
the weight of the body. Sleep is not a constant and
uniform state of consciousness; a heightened consciousness
of respiration may easily co-exist with a
diminished consciousness of tactile pressure due to
anaesthesia of the skin.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> In normal sleep it may,
indeed, be said that the conditions are probably often
favourable to the production of this combination, and
any slight thoracic disturbance even in healthy persons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
arising from heart or stomach, and acting on the
respiration, serves to bring these conditions to sleeping
consciousness and to determine the dream of
flying.</p>

<p>Dreams of flying are sometimes associated with
dreams of falling, the falling sensation occurring either
at the beginning or at the end of the dream; such a
dream may be said to be of the Icarus type.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Jewell
considers that the two kinds of dream have the same
causation, the difference being merely a difference of
apperception. The frequent connection between the
two dreams indicates that the causation is allied, but
it scarcely seems to be identical. If it were identical,
we should scarcely find that while the emotional tone
of the dream of flying is usually agreeable, that of the
dream of falling is usually disagreeable.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>I have no personal experience of the sensation of falling
in normal dreaming, although Jewell and Hutchinson
have found that it is more common than flying, the latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
regarding it, indeed, as the most common kind of dream,
the dream of flying coming next in frequency. A friend
who has no dreams of flying, but has experienced
dreams of falling from his earliest years, tells me that
they are always associated with feelings of terror. This
suggests an organic cause, and the fact that the sensation
of falling may occur in epileptic fits during sleep,<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> seems
further to suggest the presence of circulatory and
nervous disturbance. It would seem probable that
while the same two factors&mdash;respiratory and tactile&mdash;are
operative in both types of dream, they are not of
equal force in each. In the dream of flying, respiratory
activity is excited, and in response to excitation it works
at a high level adequate to the needs of the organism.
In the dream of falling it may be that respiratory
activity is depressed, while concomitantly, perhaps,
the anaesthetic state of the skin is increased. In the
first state the abnormal activity of respiration triumphs
in consciousness over the accompanying dulness of
tactile sensation; in the second state the respiratory
breathlessness is less influential than a numbness of
the skin unconscious of any external pressure. This
difference is rendered possible by the fact that in dreams
of flying we are not usually far from the earth, and seem
able to touch it lightly at intervals; that is to say that
tactile sensitiveness is impaired, but is not entirely
absent as it is in a dream of falling.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>In my own experience the sensation of falling only
occurs in illness or under the influence of drugs, sometimes
when sleep seems incomplete, and it is an
unpleasant, though not terrifying, sensation. I once
experienced it in the most marked and persistent
manner after taking a large dose of chlorodyne to
subdue pain. Under such circumstances the sensation
is probably due to the fact that the morphia in
chlorodyne both weakens respiratory action and produces
anaesthesia of the peripheral nerves, so that the
skin becomes abnormally insensitive to the contact and
pressure of the bed, and the sensation of descent is
necessarily aroused.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> It is possible that persons liable
to the dream of falling are predisposed to a stage of
sleep unconsciousness, in which cutaneous insensibility is
marked. It is also possible that there is a contributory
element of slight cardiac or respiratory disturbance.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>In a dream belonging to this group, I imagined I was
being rhythmically swung up and down in the air by a
young woman, my feet never touching the ground;
and then that I was swinging her similarly. At one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
time she seemed to be swinging me in too jerky and
hurried a manner, and I explained to her that it must be
done in a slower and more regular manner, though I
was not conscious of the precise words I used. There
had been some dyspepsia on the previous day, and
on awaking I felt slight discomfort in the region of the
heart. The symbolism into which slightly disturbed
respiratory or cardiac action is here transformed seems
very clear in this dream, because it shows the actual
transition from the subjective sensation to the objective
imagery of flying. By means of this symbolic imagery
we find sleeping consciousness commanding the hurried
heart to beat in a more healthy manner.</p>

<p>Although, in youth, my dreams of flying were of what
may be considered normal type, after the age of about
thirty-five they tended, as illustrated by the example
I have given, to take on a somewhat objective form.
A further stage in this direction, the swinging movement
being transformed to an inanimate object, is illustrated
by a dream of comparatively recent date, in which I
seemed to see an athlete of the music-hall, a graceful
and muscular man, who was manipulating a large
elastic ball, making it bound up from the floor. On
awaking there was a distinct sensation of cardaic
tremor and nervousness.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>It may seem strange that dreams of flying, if so often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
due to organic disturbances, should usually be agreeable
in character. It is not, however, necessary to
assume that they are caused by serious interference
with physiological functions; often, indeed, they may
simply be due to the presence of a stage of consciousness
in which respiration has become unduly prominent, as
it is apt to be in the early stage of nitrous oxide anaesthesia,
that is to say, to a relative wakefulness of the
respiratory centres. It would seem that the disturbance
is frequently almost, or quite, imperceptible on
waking, and by no means to be compared with the
more acute organic disturbances which result in dreams
of murder, although it may be of nervous origin.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
In some cases, however, it appears that dreams of flying
are accompanied by circumstances of terror. Thus a
medical correspondent, who describes his health as
fairly good, writes in regard to dreams of flying: 'I
have often had such dreams, and have wondered if
others have them. Mine, however, are not so much
dreams of flying, as dreams of being entirely devoid of
weight, and of rising and falling at will. A singular
feature of these levitation dreams is that they are always
accompanied by an intense and agonising fear of an evil
presence, a presence that I do not see but seem to feel,
and my greatest terror is that I <em>shall</em> see it. The
presence is ill-defined, but very real, and it seems to
suggest the potentiality of all possible moral, mental,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
and physical evil. In these dreams it always occurs
to me that if this evil presence shall ever become embodied
into a something that I could <em>see</em>, the sight of
it would be so ineffably horrible as to drive me mad.
So vivid has this fear been that on several occasions I
have awakened in a cold sweat or a nameless fear that
would persist for some minutes after I realised that I
had only been dreaming.' This seems to be an abnormal
type of the dream of flight.</p>

<p>It is somewhat surprising that while dreams of
floating in the air are so common and clearly indicate
the respiratory source of the dream, dreams of floating
on water seem to be rare, for as the actual experience
of floating on water is fairly familiar, we might have
expected that sleeping consciousness would have found
here rather than in the never experienced idea of floating
in air the explanation of its sensations. The dream
of floating on water is, however, by no means unknown;
thus Rachilde (Mme. Vallette), the French novelist
and critic, whose dream life is vivid and remarkable,
states that her most agreeable dream is that of floating
on the surface of warm and transparent lakes or rivers.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
One of the correspondents of <cite>L'interm&eacute;diaire des
Chercheurs et des Curieux</cite><a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> also states that he has often
dreamed of walking on the water.</p>

<p>It is not only in sleep that the sensation of flying is
experienced. In hysteria a sense of peculiar lightness
of the body, and the idea of the soul's power to fly, may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
occur incidentally,<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> and may certainly be connected
both with the vigilambulism, as Sollier terms the sleep-like
tendencies of such cases, and the anaesthetic conditions
found in the hysterical. It is noteworthy that
Janet found that in an ecstatic person who experienced
the sensation of rising in the air there was anaesthesia
of the soles of the feet. In such hysterical ecstasy,
which has always played so large a part in religious
manifestations, it is well known that the sense of rising
and floating in the air has often prominently appeared.
St. Theresa occasionally felt herself lifted above the
ground, and was fearful that this sign of divine favour
would attract attention (though we are not told that
that was the case), while St. Joseph of Cupertino,
Christina the Wonderful, St. Ida of Louvain, with
many another saint enshrined in the <em xml:lang="la" lang="la">Acta Sanctorum</em>,
were permitted to experience this sensation; and since
its reality is as convincing in the ecstatic state as it is
in dreams, the saints have often been able to declare,
in perfect good faith, that their levitation was real.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
In all great religious movements among primitive
peoples, similar phenomena occur, together with other
nervous and hallucinatory manifestations. They occurred,
for instance, in the great Russian religious
movement which took place among the peasants in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
the province of Kief during the winter of 1891-2. The
leader of the movement, a devout member of the
Stundist sect, a man with alcoholic heredity, who had
received the revelation that he was saviour of the world,
used not only to perceive perfumes so exquisite that
they could only, as he was convinced, emanate from
the Holy Ghost, but during prayer, together with a
feeling of joy, he also had a sensation of bodily lightness
and of floating in the air. His followers in many cases
had the same experiences, and they delighted in jumping
up into the air and shouting. In these cases the reality
of the sensory obtuseness of the skin as an element in
the manifestations was demonstrated, for Ssikorski,
who had an opportunity of investigating these people,
found that many of them, when in the ecstatic condition,
were completely insensible to pain.</p>

<p>The sensation of flying is one of the earliest to appear
in the dreams of childhood.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> It is sometimes the last
sensation at the moment of death. To rise, to fall, to
glide away, has often been the last conscious sensation
recalled by those who seemed to be dying, but have
afterwards been brought back to life. Those rescued
from drowning, for instance, have sometimes found that
the last conscious sensation was a beatific feeling of
being borne upwards. Pi&eacute;ron has also noted this
sensation at the moment of death from disease in a
number of cases, usually accompanied by a sense of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
well-being.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> The cases he describes were mostly tuberculous,
and included individuals of both sexes, and of
atheistic as well as religious belief. In all, the last sensation
to which expression was given was one of flying, of
moving upwards. In some death was peaceful, in others
painful. In one case a girl died clasping the iron bars of
the bed, in horror of being borne upwards. Pi&eacute;ron, no
doubt rightly, associates this sensation with the similar
sensation of rising and floating common in dreams, and
with the feeling of moving upwards and resting on the
air experienced by persons in the ecstatic state. In all
these cases alike life is being concentrated in the brain
and central organs, while the outlying districts of the
body are becoming numb and dead.</p>

<p>In this way it comes about that out of dreams and of
dream-like waking states, one of the most permanent
of human spiritual conceptions has been evolved. To
float, to rise into the air, to fly up to heaven, has always
seemed to man to be the final climax of spiritual activity.
The angel is the most ethereal creature the human
imagination can conceive. Browning's cry to his 'lyric
love, half angel and half bird,' pathetically crude as
poetry, is sound as psychology. The prophets and
divine heroes of the race have constantly seemed to
their devout followers to disappear at last by floating
up into the sky, like Elijah, who went up 'by a whirlwind
into heaven.' St. Peter once thought he saw his
Master walking on the waves, and the last vision of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Jesus in the Gospels reveals him rising into the air.
For it is in the world of dreams that the human soul
has its indestructible home, and in the attempt to
realise these dreams lies a large part of our business
in life.</p>

<p>In discussing dreams of flying I have referred to a dream
in which a slight disturbance of the heart's action was
transformed by sleeping consciousness into the image of
an athlete manipulating an elastic ball. This objectivation
of what are really the dreamer's subjective sensations,
although he is not conscious of them as subjective,
is, indeed, a phenomenon which we have
encountered many times. It is, however, so important
a feature of dream psychology, and probably of such
significant weight in its influence on waking life, that it
is worth while to deal with it separately.</p>

<p>The dramatisation of subjective elements of the
personality, which contributes so largely to render our
dreams vivid and interesting, rests on that dissociation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
or falling apart of the constituent groups of psychic
centres, which is so fundamental a fact of dream life.
That is to say, that the usually coherent elements of
our mental life are split up, and some of them&mdash;often,
it is curious to note, precisely those which are at that
very moment the most prominent and poignant&mdash;are
reconstituted into what seems to us an outside and
objective world, of which we are the interested or the
merely curious spectators, but in neither case realise
that we are ourselves the origin of.</p>

<p>An elementary source of this tendency to objectivation
is to be found, it may be noted, in the automatic
impulse towards symbolism by which all sorts of feelings
experienced by the dreamer become transformed
into concrete visible images. When objectivation is
thus attained, dissociation may be said to be secondary.
So far indeed as I am able to dissect the dream-process,
the tendency to symbolism seems nearly always to precede
the dissociation in consciousness, though it may
well be that the dissociation of the mental elements is
a necessary subconscious condition for the symbolism.</p>

<p>Sensory symbolism rests on a very fundamental
psychic tendency. On the abnormal side we find it in
the synaesthesias which, since Galton first drew attention
to them in 1883, in his <cite>Inquiries into Human Faculty</cite>,
have become well known, and are found among between
six to over twelve per cent. of people. Galton investigated
chiefly those kinds of synaesthesias which he
called 'number-forms' and 'colour associations.' The
number-form is characteristic of those people who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
almost invariably think of numerals in some more or
less constant form of visual imagery, the number
instantaneously calling up the picture. In persons who
experience colour-associations, or coloured-hearing, there
is a similar instantaneous manifestation of particular
colours in connection with particular sounds, the
different vowel sounds, for instance, each constantly
and persistently evolving a definite tint, as <em>a</em> white,
<em>e</em> vermilion, <em>i</em> yellow, etc., no two persons, however,
having exactly the same colour scheme of
sounds.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> These phenomena are not so very rare,
and, though they must be regarded as abnormal,
they occur in persons who are perfectly healthy and
sane.</p>

<p>It will be seen that a synaesthesia&mdash;which may involve
taste, smell, and other senses besides hearing and
sight&mdash;causes an impression of one sensory order to be
automatically and involuntarily linked on to an impression
of another totally different order. In other
words, we may say that the one impression becomes the
<em>symbol</em> of the other impression, for a symbol&mdash;which is
literally a throwing together&mdash;means that two things
of different orders have become so associated that one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
of them may be regarded as the sign and representative
of the other.</p>

<p>There is, however, another still more natural and
fundamental form of symbolism which is entirely
normal, and almost, indeed, physiological. This is the
tendency by which qualities of one order become
symbols of qualities of a totally different order, because
they instinctively seem to have a similar effect on us.
In this way, things in the physical order become
symbols of things in the spiritual order. This symbolism
penetrates indeed the whole of language; we cannot
escape from it. The sea is <em>deep</em>, and so also may
thoughts be; ice is <em>cold</em>, and we say the same of
some hearts; sugar is <em>sweet</em>, as the lover finds also the
presence of the beloved; quinine is <em>bitter</em>, and so is
remorse. Not only our adjectives, but our substantives
and our verbs are equally symbolical. To the etymological
eye every sentence is full of metaphor, of symbol,
of images that, strictly and originally, express sensory
impressions of one order, but, as we use them to-day,
express impressions of a totally different order. Language
is largely the utilisation of symbols. This is
a well-recognised fact which it is unnecessary to
elaborate.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>An interesting example of the natural tendency to
symbolism, which may be compared to the allied
tendency in dreaming, is furnished by another language,
the language of music. Music is a representation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the world&mdash;the internal or the external world&mdash;which,
except in so far as it may seek to reproduce the actual
sounds of the world, can only be expressive by its
symbolism. And the symbolism of music is so pronounced
that it is even expressed in the elementary
fact of musical pitch. Our minds are so constructed
that the bass always seems <em>deep</em> to us and the treble
<em>high</em>. We feel it incongruous to speak of a <em>high</em> bass
voice or a <em>deep</em> soprano. It is difficult to avoid the
conclusion that this and the like associations are fundamentally
based, that there are, as an acute French
philosophic student of music, Dauriac (in an essay
'Des Images Sugg&eacute;r&eacute;es par l'Audition musicale'<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>),
has expressed it, 'sensorial correspondences,' as, indeed,
Baudelaire had long since divined<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>; that the
motor image is that which demands from the listener
the minimum of effort; and that music almost constantly
evokes motor imagery.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>The association between high notes and physical
ascent, between low notes and physical descent, is certainly
in any case very fixed.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> In Wagner's <em>Lohengrin</em>,
the ascent and descent of the angelic chorus is thus
indicated. Even if we go back to the early composers,
the same correspondence is found. In Purcell it is
very definite. In Bach&mdash;pure and abstract as his music
is generally considered&mdash;not only this elementary
association, but an immense amount of motor imagery
is to be found; Bach shows, indeed, a curious pre-occupation
in translating the definite sense of the words
he is musically illustrating into corresponding musical
terms; the skill and subtlety with which he accomplishes
this, can often, as Pirro and Schweitzer have
shown, be appreciated only by musicians.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
sometimes said that this is 'realism' in music. That is
a mistake. When the impressions derived from one
sense are translated into those of another sense, there
can be no question of realism. A composer may
attempt a realistic representation of thunder, but his
representation of lightning can only be symbolical;
audible lightning can never be realistic.</p>

<p>Not only is there an instinctive and direct association
between sounds and motor imagery, but there is an
indirect but equally instinctive association between
sounds and visual imagery which, though not itself
motor, has motor associations. Thus Bleuler considers
it well established that among colour-hearers
there is a tendency for photisms that are light in colour
(and belonging, we may say, to the 'high' part of the
spectrum) to be produced by sounds of high quality,
and dark photisms by sounds of low quality; and, in
the same way, sharply-defined pains or tactile sensations,
as well as pointed forms, produce light photisms. Similarly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
bright lights and pointed forms produce high
photisms, whole low photisms are produced by opposite
conditions. Urbantschitsch, again, by examining a
large number of people who were not colour-hearers,
found that a high note of a tuning-fork seems higher
when looking at red, yellow, green, or blue, but lower
if looking at violet. Thus two sensory qualities that
are both symbolic of a third quality are symbolic to
each other.</p>

<p>This symbolism, we are justified in believing, is
based on fundamental organic tendencies. Piderit,
nearly half a century ago, forcibly argued that there is
a real relationship of our most spiritual feelings and
ideas to particular bodily movements and facial expressions.
In a similar manner, he pointed out that
bitter tastes and bitter thoughts tend to produce the
same physical expression.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> He also argued that the
character of a man's looks&mdash;his <em>fixed</em> or <em>dreamy</em> eyes,
his <em>lively</em> or <em>stiff</em> movements&mdash;correspond to real psychic
characters. If this is so we have a physiological, almost
anatomical, basis for symbolism. Cleland,<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> again, in
an essay, 'On the Element of Symbolic Correlation
in Expression,' argued that the key to a great part of
expression is the correlation of movements and positions
with ideas, so that there are, for instance, a host of
associations in the human mind by which 'upward'
represents the good, the great, and the living, while
'downward' represents the evil and the dead. Such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
associations are so fundamental that they are found
even in animals, whose gestures are, as F&eacute;r&eacute;<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> remarked,
often metaphorical, so that a cat, for instance, will
shake its paw, as if in contact with water, after any
disagreeable experiences.</p>

<p>The symbolism that to-day interpenetrates our language,
and indeed our life generally, has mostly been
inherited by us, with the traditions of civilisation,
from an antiquity so primitive that we usually fail to
interpret it. The rare additions we make to it in our
ordinary normal life are for the most part deliberately
conscious. But so soon as we fall below, or rise above,
that ordinary normal level&mdash;to insanity and hallucination,
to childhood, to savagery, to folk-lore and legend,
to poetry and religion&mdash;we are at once plunged into a
sea of symbolism.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> There is even a normal sphere in
which symbolism has free scope, and that is in the world
of dreams.</p>

<p>Oneiromancy, the symbolical interpretation of dreams,
more especially as a method of divining the future, is a
widespread art in early stages of culture. The discerning
of dreams is represented in the Old Testament
as a very serious and anxious matter (as in regard to
Pharaoh's dream of the fat and lean cattle), and,
nearer to our time, the dreams of great heroes, especially
Charlemagne, are represented as highly important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
events in the medi&aelig;val European epics. Little manuals
on the interpretation of dreams have always been much
valued by the uncultured classes, and among our
current popular sayings there are many dicta concerning
the significance, or the good or ill luck, of particular
kinds of dreams.</p>

<p>Oneiromancy has thus slowly degenerated to folk-lore
and superstition. But at the outset it possessed
something of the combined dignities of religion and of
science. Not only were the old dream interpreters
careful of the significance and results of individual
dreams, in order to build up a body of doctrine, but they
held that not every dream contained in it a divine
message; thus they would not condescend to interpret
dreams following on the drinking of wine, for only to
the temperate, they declared, do the gods reveal their
secrets.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> The serious and elaborate way in which the
interpretation of dreams was dealt with is well seen in
the treatise on this subject by Artemidorus of Daldi,
a native of Ephesus, and contemporary of Marcus
Aurelius.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> He divided dreams into two classes:
<em>theorematic</em> dreams, which come literally true, and
<em>allegorical</em> dreams. The first group may be said to
correspond to the modern groups of prophetic and
proleptic or prodromic dreams, while the second group
includes the symbolical dreams which have of recent
years again attracted attention. Synesius, who lived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
in the fourth century, and eventually became a Christian
bishop without altogether ceasing to be a Greek pagan,
wrote a very notable treatise on dreaming, in which,
with a genuinely Greek alertness of mind, he contrived
to rationalise and almost to modernise the ancient
doctrine of dream symbolism. He admits that it is in
their obscurity that the truth of dreams resides, and
that we must not expect to find any general rules in
regard to dreams; no two people are alike, so that the
same dream cannot have the same significance for every
one, and we have to find out the rules of our own dreams.
He had himself (like Galen) often been aided in his
writings by his dreams, in this way getting his ideas
into order, improving his style, and receiving criticisms
of extravagant phrases. Once, too, in the days when
he hunted, he invented a trap as a result of a dream.
Synesius declares that attention to divination by
dreams is good on moral grounds alone. For he who
makes his bed a Delphian tripod will be careful to live
a pure and noble life. In that way he will reach an end
higher than that he aimed at.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>It seems to-day by no means improbable that, amid
the absurdities of this popular oneiromancy, there are
some items of real significance. Until recent years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
however, the absurdities have frightened away the
scientific investigator. Almost the only investigator
of the psychology of dreaming who ventured to admit
a real symbolism in the dream world was Scherner,<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
and his arguments were not usually accepted nor even
easy to accept. When we are faced by the question
of definite and constant symbols it still remains true
that scepticism is often called for. But there can
be no manner of doubt that our dreams are full of
symbolism.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>The conditions of dream life, indeed, lend themselves
with a peculiar facility to the formation of
symbolism, that is to say, of images which, while
evoked by a definite stimulus, are themselves of a totally
different order from that stimulus. The very fact that
we <em>sleep</em>, that is to say, that the avenues of sense which
would normally supply the real image of corresponding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
order to the stimulus are more or less closed, renders
symbolism inevitable.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> The direct channels being thus
largely choked, other allied and parallel associations
come into play, and since the control of attention
and apperception is diminished, such play is often unimpeded.
Symbolism is the natural and inevitable result
of these conditions.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>It might still be asked why we do not in dreams more
often recognise the actual source of the stimuli applied
to us. If a dreamer's feet are in contact with something
hot, it might seem more natural that he should
think of the actual hot-water bottle, rather than of an
imaginary Etna, and that, if he hears a singing in his
ears, he should argue the presence of the real bird he
has often heard rather than a performance of Haydn's
<em>Creation</em>, which he has never heard. Here, however,
we have to remember the tendency to magnification
in dream imagery, a tendency which rests on the emotionality
of dreams. Emotion is normally heightened
in dreams. Every impression reaches sleeping consciousness
through this emotional atmosphere, in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
enlarged form, vaguer it may be, but more massive.
The sleeping brain is thus not dealing with actual
impressions&mdash;if we are justified in speaking of the
impressions of waking life as 'actual'&mdash;even when
actual impressions are being made upon it, but with
transformed impressions. The problem before it is to
find an adequate cause, not for the actual impression,
but for the transformed and enlarged impression.
Under these circumstances symbolism is quite inevitable.
Even when the nature of an excitation is rightly perceived
its quality cannot be rightly perceived. The
dreamer may be able to perceive that he is being bitten,
but the massive and profound impression of a bite
which reaches his dreaming consciousness would not
be adequately accounted for by the supposition of the
real mosquito that is the cause of it; the only adequate
explanation of the transformed impression received
is to be found (as in a dream already narrated) in a
creature as large as a lobster. This creature is the
symbol of the real mosquito.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> We have the same
phenomenon under somewhat similar conditions in the
intoxication of chloroform and nitrous oxide.</p>

<p>The obscuration during sleep of the external sensory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
channels, with the checks on false conclusions they
furnish, is not alone sufficient to explain the symbolism
of dreams. The dissociation of thought during sleep,
with the diminished attention and apperception involved,
is also a factor. The magnification of special
isolated sensory impressions in dreaming consciousness
is associated with a general bluntness, even an absolute
quiescence, of the external sensory mechanism. One
part of the organism, and it seems usually a visceral
part, is thus apt to magnify its place in consciousness
at the expense of the rest. As Vaschide and Pi&eacute;ron say,
during sleep 'the internal sensations develop at the
expense of the peripheral sensations.' That indeed
seems to be the secret of the immense emotional turmoil
of our dreams. Yet it is very rare for these internal
sensations to reach the sleeping brain as what they are.
They become conscious, not as literal messages, but as
symbolical transformations. The excited or labouring
heart recalls to the brain no memory of itself, but some
symbolical image of excitement or labour. There is
association, indeed, but it is association not along the
matter-of-fact lines of our ordinary waking civilised
life, but along much more fundamental and primitive
channels, which in waking life we have now abandoned
or never knew.</p>

<p>There is another consideration which may be put forward
to account for one group of dream-symbolisms.
It has been found that certain hysterical subjects of old
standing when in the hypnotic state are able to receive
mental pictures of their own viscera, even though they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
may be quite ignorant of any knowledge of the shape
of these viscera. This <em>autoscopy</em>, as it has been called,
has been specially studied by F&eacute;r&eacute;, Comar, and Sollier.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>
Hysteria is a condition which is in many respects closely
allied to sleep, and if it is to be accepted as a real fact
that autoscopy occasionally occurs in the abnormal
psychic state of hypnotic sleep in hysterical persons,
it is possible to ask whether it may not sometimes
occur normally in the allied state of sleep. In the
hypnotic state it is known that parts of the organism
normally involuntary may become subject to the will;
it is not incredible that similarly parts normally
insensitive may become sufficiently sensitive to reveal
their own shape or condition. We may thus, indeed,
the more easily understand those premonitory dreams
in which the dreamer becomes conscious of morbid
conditions which are not perceptible to waking consciousness
until they have attained a greater degree of
intensity.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>The recognition of the transformation in dream life
of internal sensations into symbolic motor imagery is
ancient. Hippocrates said that to dream, for instance,
of springs and wells denoted some disturbance of the
bladder. In such a case a disturbed bladder sends to
the brain, not the naked message of its own needs, but
a symbolic message of those needs in motor imagery,
as (in one case known to me) of a large cistern with a
stream of water flowing from it.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> Sometimes the
symbolism aroused by visceral processes remains
physiological; thus indigestion frequently leads to
dreams of eating, as of chewing all sorts of inedible
and repulsive substances, and occasionally&mdash;it would
seem more abnormally&mdash;to agreeable dreams of food.</p>

<p>It is due to the genius of Professor Sigmund Freud,
of Vienna&mdash;to-day the most daring and original psychologist
in the field of morbid psychic phenomena&mdash;that
we owe the long-neglected recognition of the large
place of symbolism in dreaming. Scherner had argued
in favour of this aspect of dreams, but he was an
undistinguished and unreliable psychologist, and his
arguments failed to be influential. Freud avows
himself a partisan of Scherner's theory of dreaming and
opponent of all other theories,<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> but his treatment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the matter is incomparably more searching and profound.
Freud, however, goes far beyond the fundamental&mdash;and,
as I believe, undeniable&mdash;proposition
that dream-imagery is largely symbolic. He holds
that behind the symbolism of dreams there lies ultimately
a <em>wish;</em> he believes, moreover, that this wish tends
to be really of more or less sexual character, and, further,
that it is tinged by elements that go back to the dreamer's
infantile days. As Freud views the mechanism of
dreams, it is far from exhibiting mere disordered mental
activity, but is (much as he has also argued hysteria
to be<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>) the outcome of a desire, which is driven back by
a kind of inhibition or censure (<em>i.e.</em>, that kind of moral
check which is still more alert in the waking state), and
is seeking new forms of expression. There is first in
the dream the process of what Freud calls condensation
(<em>Verdichtung</em>), a process which is that fusion of separate
elements which must be recognised at the outset of
every discussion of dreaming, but Freud maintains that
in this fusion all the elements have a point in common,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
and overlie one another like the pictures in a Galtonian
composite photograph. Then there comes the process
of displacement or transference (<em>Verschiebung</em>), a process
by which the really central and emotional basis of the
dream is concealed beneath trifles. Then there is the
process of dramatisation or transformation into a concrete
situation of which the elements have a symbolic
value. Thus, as Maeder puts it, summarising Freud's
views, 'behind the apparently insignificant events of
the day utilised in the dream there is always an important
idea or event hidden. We only dream of things
that are worth while. What at first sight seems to be
a trifle is a grey wall which hides a great palace. The
significance of the dream is not so much held in the
dream itself as in that substratum of it which has not
passed the threshold and which analysis alone can bring
to light.'</p>

<p>'We only dream of things that are worth while.'
That is the point at which many of us are no longer
able to follow Freud. That dreams of the type studied
by Freud do actually occur may be accepted; it may
even be considered proved. But to assert that all
dreams must be made to fit into this one formula is to
make far too large a demand. As regards the presentative
element in dreams&mdash;the element that is based
on actual sensory stimulation&mdash;it is in most cases unreasonable
to invoke Freud's formula at all. If, when
I am asleep, the actual song of a bird causes me to dream
that I am at a concert, that picture may be regarded as
a natural symbol of the actual sensation, and it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
unreasonable to expect that psycho-analysis could reveal
any hidden personal reason why the symbol should
take the form of a concert. And, if so, then Freud's
formula fails to hold good for phenomena which cover
one of the two main divisions of dreams, even on a
superficial classification, and perhaps enter into all
dreams.</p>

<p>But even if we take dreams of the remaining or
representative class&mdash;the dreams made up of images
not directly dependent on actual sensation&mdash;we still
have to maintain a cautious attitude. A very large
proportion of the dreams in this class seem to be, so
far as the personal life is concerned, in no sense 'worth
while.' It would, indeed, be surprising if they were.
It seems to be fairly clear that in sleep, as certainly
in the hypnagogic state, attention is diminished, and
apperceptive power weakened. That alone seems to
involve a relaxation of the tension by which we will
and desire our personal ends. At the same time, by no
longer concentrating our psychic activities at the focus
of desire it enables indifferent images to enter more easily
the field of sleeping consciousness. It might even be
argued that the activity of desire, when it manifests
itself in sleep and follows the course indicated by
Freud, corresponds to a special form of sleep in which
attention and apperception, though in modified forms,
are more active than in ordinary sleep.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> Such dreams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
seem to occur with special frequency, or in more definitely
marked forms, in the neurotic and especially the
hysterical, and if it is true that the hysterical are to
some extent asleep even when they are awake, it may
also be said that they are to some extent awake even
when they are asleep. Freud certainly holds, probably
with truth, that there is no fundamental distinction
between normal people and psychoneurotic people,
and that there is, for instance, as Ferenczi says, emphasising
this point, 'a streak of hysterical disposition
in everybody.' Freud has, indeed, made interesting
analytic studies of his own dreams, but the great body
of material accumulated by him and his school is derived
from the dreams of the neurotic. Thus Stekel states
that he has analysed many thousand dreams, but his
lengthy study on the interpretation of dreams deals
exclusively with the dreams of the neurotic.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> Stekel
believes, moreover, that from the structure of the dream
life conclusions may be drawn, not only as to the life
and character of the dreamer, but also as to his neurosis,
the hysterical person dreaming differently from the
obsessed person, and so on. If that is the case we are
certainly justified in doubting whether conclusions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
drawn from the study of the dreams of neurotic people
can be safely held to represent the normal dream life,
even though it may be true that there is no definite
frontier between them. Whatever may be the case
among the neurotic, in ordinary normal sleep the images
that drift across the field of consciousness, though they
have a logic of their own, seem in a large proportion of
cases to be quite explicable without resort to the theory
that they stand in vital but concealed relationship to
our most intimate self.</p>

<p>Even in waking life, and at normal moments which
are not those of reverie, it seems possible to trace the
appearance in the field of consciousness of images which
are evoked neither by any known mental or physical
circumstance of the moment, or any hidden desire,
images that are as disconnected from the immediate
claims of desire and even of association as those of
dreams seem so largely to be. It sometimes occurs to
me&mdash;as doubtless it occurs to other people&mdash;that at
some moment when my thoughts are normally occupied
with the work immediately before me, there suddenly
appears on the surface of consciousness a totally unrelated
picture. A scene arises, vague but usually
recognisable, of some city or landscape&mdash;Australian,
Russian, Spanish, it matters not what&mdash;seen casually
long years ago, and possibly never thought of since,
and possessing no kind of known association either
with the matter in hand or with my personal life generally.
It comes to the surface of consciousness as softly,
as unexpectedly, as disconnectedly, as a minute bubble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
might arise and break on the surface of an actual stream
from ancient organic material silently disintegrating
in the depths beneath.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> Every one who has travelled
much cannot fail to possess, hidden in his psychic depths,
a practically infinite number of such forgotten pictures,
devoid of all personal emotion. It is possible to maintain,
as a matter of theory, that when they come up to
consciousness, they are evoked by some real, though
untraceable, resemblance which they possess to the
psychic or physical state existing when they reappear.
But that theory cannot be demonstrated. Nor, it
may be added, is it more plausible than the simple but
equally unprovable theory that such scenes do really
come to the surface of consciousness as the result of
some slight spontaneous disintegration in a minute
cerebral centre, and have no more immediately preceding
psychic cause than my psychic realisation of
the emergence of the sun from behind a cloud has any
psychic preceding cause.</p>

<p>Similarly, in insanity, Liepmann, in his study <cite>Ueber
Ideenflucht</cite>, has forcibly argued that ordinary logorrhœa&mdash;the
incontinence of ideas linked together by superficial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
associations of resemblance or contiguity&mdash;is a
linking <em>without direction</em>, that is, corresponding to no
interest, either practical or theoretical, of the individual.
Or, as Clapar&egrave;de puts it, logorrhœa is a trouble in the
reaction of <em>interest</em> in life. It seems most reasonable
to believe that in ordinary sleep the flow of imagery
follows, for the most part, the same easy course. That
course may to waking consciousness often seem peculiar,
but to waking consciousness the conditions of dreaming
life are peculiar. Under these conditions, however, we
may well believe that the tendency to movement in the
direction of least resistance still prevails. And as
attention and will are weakened and loosened during
sleep, the tense concentration on personal ends must also
be relaxed. We become more disinterested. Personal
desire tends for the most part rather to fall into the background
than to become more prominent. If it were not
a period in which desire were ordinarily relaxed, sleep
would cease to be a period of rest and recuperation.</p>

<p>Sleeping consciousness is a vast world, a world scarcely
less vast than that of waking consciousness. It is
futile to imagine that a single formula can cover all its
manifold varieties and all its degrees of depth. Those
who imagine that all dreaming is a symbolism which a
single cypher will serve to interpret must not be surprised
if, however unjustly, they are thought to resemble
those persons who claim to find on every page of Shakespeare
a cypher revealing the authorship of Bacon.
In the case of Freud's theory of dream interpretation,
I hold the cypher to be real, but I believe that it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
impossible to regard so narrow and exclusive an interpretation
as adequate to explain the whole world of
dreams. It would, <em>a priori</em>, be incomprehensible that
sleeping consciousness should exert so extraordinary a
selective power among the variegated elements of waking
life, and, experientially, there seems no adequate
ground to suppose that it does exert such selective
action. On the contrary, it is, for the most part,
supremely impartial in bringing forward and combining
all the manifestations, the most trivial as well as the
most intimate, of our waking life. There is a symptom
of mental disorder called <em>extrospection</em>, in which the
patient fastens his attention so minutely on events that
he comes to interpret the most trifling signs and incidents
as full of hidden significance, and may so build
up a systematised delusion.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> The investigator of
dreams must always bear in mind the risk of falling
into morbid extrospection.</p>

<p>Such considerations seem to indicate that it is not
true that every dream, every mental image, is 'worth
while,' though at the same time they by no means
diminish the validity of special and purposive methods
of investigating dream consciousness. Freud and those
who are following him have shown, by the expenditure
of much patience and skill, that his method of dream-interpretation
may in many cases yield coherent results
which it is not easy to account for by chance. It is
quite possible, however, to recognise Freud's service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
in vindicating the large place of symbolism in dreams,
and to welcome the application of his psycho-analytic
method to dreams, while yet denying that this is the
only method of interpreting dreams. Freud argues
that all dreaming is purposive and significant, and that
we must put aside the belief that dreams are the mere
trivial outcome of the dissociated activity of brain
centres. It remains true, however, that, while reason
plays a larger part in dreams than most people realise,
the activity of dissociated brain centres furnishes one
of the best keys to the explanation of psychic phenomena
during sleep. It would be difficult to believe in
any case that in the relaxation of sleep our thoughts
are still pursuing a deliberately purposeful direction
under the control of our waking impulses. Many
facts indicate&mdash;though Freud's school may certainly
claim that such facts have not been thoroughly interpreted&mdash;that,
as a matter of fact, this control is
often conspicuously lacking. There is, for instance,
the well-known fact that our most recent and acute
emotional experiences&mdash;precisely those which might
most ardently formulate themselves in a wish&mdash;are
rarely mirrored in our dreams, though recent occurrences
of more trivial nature, as well as older events
of more serious import, easily find place there. That
is easily accounted for by the supposition&mdash;not quite
in a line with a generalised wish-theory&mdash;that the
exhausted emotions of the day find rest at night.</p>

<p>It must also be said that even when we admit that a
strong emotion may symbolically construct an elaborate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
dream edifice which needs analysis to be interpreted,
we narrow the process unduly if we assert that the
emotion is necessarily a wish. Desire is certainly very
fundamental in life and very primitive. But there is
another equally fundamental and primitive emotion&mdash;fear.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>
We may very well expect to find this emotion,
as well as desire, subjacent to dream phenomena.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>The infantile form of the wish-dream, alike in
adults and children, is thus, there can be little doubt,
extremely common, and, even in its symbolic forms,
it is a real and not rare phenomenon. But it is impossible
to follow Freud when he declares that all
dreams fall into the group of wish-dreams. The
world of psychic life during sleep is, like the waking
world, rich and varied; it cannot be covered by a single
formula. Freud's subtle and searching analytic genius
has greatly contributed to enlarge our knowledge of
this world of sleep. We may recognise the value of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
his contribution to the psychology of dreams while
refusing to accept a premature and narrow generalisation.</p>

<p>The wish-dream of the kind elaborately investigated
by Freud may be accepted as one type of dreaming,
and a very interesting type, but it seems evident that
it is only one type. There are even other types which
seem closely related to it, and yet are quite distinct.
This is, for instance, the case with the contrast-dream.
The contrast-dream of N&auml;cke's type represents the
emergence of characteristics which are distinctly opposed
to the dreamer's character and habits. Thus,
in the course of four consecutive nights, I have dreamed
in much detail that (1) I was the mayor of a large
northern city about to take the chair at a local meeting
of the Bible Society; (2) that I was a soldier in the
heat of battle; and (3) that I was meditating the step
of going on the stage as a comedian&mdash;the only r&ocirc;le of
the three which seemed to cause me any nervousness or
misgiving. In contrast-dreams of this type we are not
concerned with the eruption of concealed and repressed
wishes. They are merely based on vestigial possibilities,
entirely alien to our temperament as it has
developed in life, and only a part of our complex personalities
in the sense that, as Schopenhauer said, whatever
path we take in life there are latent germs within us
which could only have developed in an exactly opposite
path. Even the very same dream may be due to quite
different causes. To take a very simple dream, for we
may best argue on the simplest facts: the dream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
of eating. We dream of eating when we are hungry,
but sometimes we also dream of eating when the stomach
is suffering from repletion. The dream is the same,
but the psychological mechanism is entirely different,
in the one case emotional, in the other intellectual.
In the first case the picture of eating is built up in response
to an organic visceral craving, and we have an
elementary wish-dream of what Freud would call infantile
type; in the second case the same dream is a
theory, embodied in a concrete picture, to account for
the existence of the repletion experienced.</p>

<p>There cannot be the slightest doubt that the wish-dream,
in its simple or what Freud calls its infantile
form, represents an extremely common type of dream.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
A large number of the dreams of children are concerned
with wishes and their fulfilments. Those dreams of
adults which are aroused by actual organic sensations
also tend to fall, though not invariably, into the same
form. Again, we chance to want a thing when we are
awake; when we are asleep we dream we have found it.
It may also be said, almost with certainty, that in some
cases our dreams are the fulfilment of unexpressed and
unconscious waking wishes. Even the best people,
it is probable, may occasionally dream of events which
represent the fulfilment of wishes they have never
consciously formulated. Archbishop Laud was accustomed
to note down his dreams in his Diary. On one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
occasion we find him setting down a disturbing dream,
in which he saw the Lord Keeper dead, and 'rotten
already.' A little later we find that Laud is 'much
concerned at the envy and undeserved hatred borne
to me by the Lord Keeper.'<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> It is not difficult to see
in the Archbishop's relations to the Lord Keeper an
explanation of his dream.</p>

<p>If, however, wishes, conscious or unconscious, are
often fulfilled in dreams, and if, as we have seen reason
to conclude, symbolism is a fundamental tendency of
dreaming activity, it is inevitable that wish-dreams
should sometimes take on a symbolic form. It is thus,
for instance, that I interpret my dream of being in an
English cathedral and seeing on the wall a notice to
the effect that at evensong on such a day the edifice
will not be illuminated, in order to avoid attracting
moths; I awake with a slight headache, and the unilluminated
cathedral was the symbol of the coolness
and absence of glare which one desires when suffering
from headache.</p>

<p>There cannot, also, be any doubt that erotic wishes
frequently make themselves felt as dreams, both in the
infantile and the symbolic form. It is sufficient to
bring forward one illustration. It is furnished by a
young lady of somewhat neurotic tendencies and
heredity, aged twenty-three, musical and intelligent,
who was in love with her music-master, the organist
at her church. The dream was written down at the
time. 'I was at the school of my childhood, and I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
told that I was St. Agnes Virgin and Martyr, and in
five minutes' time I was to be beheaded with a large
knife. The sheen of the blade frightened me so much
that I asked if instead I might be strangled by the man
I was in love with. Permission was given if I could
induce him to come in time. I ran to our church
(saying to myself that I knew it was a dream, but that
I <em>must</em> see what he would say) over huge stones that
cut my bare feet, and wondered what age I was living
in, longing to meet some women in order to find out.
When I did, they all wore crinolines. I rushed up the
central aisle, which was full of people, thinking that, as
I was going to be killed, nothing could matter. Mr. T.
(the organist) was giving a choir practice in the vestry.
I ran up to him and said: "Come at once, I am going
to be killed." He became very angry, and said: "Do
go away; you are always interrupting my choir
practice." I said: "Don't you understand? I am
going to be killed at once; there is a knife hanging over
my head, but I would rather be strangled by you, and
they said I could if I fetched you in time." As soon as
he understood that he came at once. Then it seemed in
the dream that we were married, and had a son, who
was to be a musical composer. I said I must say goodbye
to this son first, and told the nurse to bring him to
me. When he came I said: "Good-bye, I am going
to be killed." He said, "Mother, am I a boy or a girl?
When I am with boys I don't seem like them, and they
call me a girl, and yet I don't look like a girl." I
replied: "You are both in one, because you are going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
to be a perfect musical genius."' In this dream, which
represents the fulfilment in sleep of an affection unsatisfied
in life, we see side by side the infantile and the
symbolic fulfilments of the erotic wish, culminating
in a gifted musical child. The wish to be strangled is an
undoubted erotic symbol,<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> and it is significant that in
the course of the dream the accepted death by strangulation
became fused with marriage, although the idea
of death still inconsistently survives, doubtless because
dream consciousness failed to realise that the accepted
form of death was a subconsciously furnished symbol
of the consummation of marriage.</p>

<p>The wish-dream of Freud's type has presented itself
for consideration here, because it is a special and
elaborate illustration of symbolism in dreaming.
The important place of symbols in dreaming is by
no means dependent on the validity of this particular
type of dream, and we may now proceed to
continue the discussion of the significance of the
symbolic tendency during sleep in its most important
form.</p>

<p>The symbols we have so far been mainly concerned
with have been the result of a tendency of dreaming
consciousness to objectify feelings and affections within
the organism in concrete objects or processes outside
the organism. In its complete form this symbolic
tendency becomes the objectivation of part of the
dreamer's feelings or personality in a distinct imaginary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
personality. A process of dramatisation occurs, and
the dreamer finds himself in action and reaction, friendly
or hostile or indifferent, with seemingly external personalities
which, by the light of the analysis possible on
awakening, are demonstrably created out of split-off
portions of his own personality.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> A common and
simple form of such objectivation, closely allied to some
of the symbolisms already brought forward, occurs
when the dreamer sees the image of a person suffering
from some affection of a part of the body and finds on
awakening that he is himself experiencing pain or discomfort
in that part. Thus a medical man dreams he
is examining a tumour in a patient's groin, and on
awakening finds slight irritation in the same region of
his own body. And similarly, just as our bodily needs,
when experienced during sleep, may be symbolised by
inanimate natural objects and processes, so they may
also become objective in the image of another person
who is occupied in gratifying the need which we are
ourselves unconsciously experiencing.</p>

<p>An interesting and significant group of cases is
furnished by those dreams in which&mdash;as the result of
some compression or effort&mdash;the tactile and muscular
sensations of our own limbs are split off from sleeping
consciousness and built up into an imaginary personality.
Thus a medical friend, shortly after an attack
of influenza, dreamed that in conversation with a lady
patient his hand rested on her knee; she requested him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
to remove it, but his efforts to do so were fruitless, and he
awoke in horror from this unprofessional situation to
find that his hand was firmly clasped between his own
knees. His body had thus been divided in dreaming
consciousness between himself and an imaginary other
person; the knee had become the other person's,
while the hand remained his own, the hand being
claimed in preference to the knee no doubt on account
of its greater tactile sensibility and more complexly
intimate association with the brain. In the hypnagogic
(or hypnopompic) state such dream sensations may
almost reach the intensity of hallucination. Thus,
after an indigestible supper, I awake with the vivid
feeling that some one is lying on me and attempting
to drag off the bedclothes, and I find myself violently
attempting, but apparently in vain, to articulate: 'Who
is there?' In a dream of similar type, which occurred
when lying on my back (and possibly with slight indigestion
due to an unusually late dinner), I awoke
making a kind of inarticulate exclamation which
awakened my wife. I had dreamed that I was lying
in bed, and that some unseen creature&mdash;more supernatural
than human, it seemed&mdash;was violently dragging
the bedclothes off me, while I shouted to it, very distinctly
it seemed to me, 'Avaunt, avaunt!'</p>

<p>It is evident that my own sense of oppression, my
own unconscious and involuntary movements in disturbing
the bedclothes, were reconstructed by sleeping
consciousness as the actions of an external person, in
the second case, a supernatural creature, which, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
interesting to note, I duly accepted as such and addressed
in the conventionally appropriate manner of old
romance. The illusion may persist for some moments
after waking. A lady, after breathing rather loudly
and convulsively for a few seconds, wakes up, saying
'There is a rat or a mouse on the bed, shaking it up and
down.' 'You were asleep,' her husband replied, 'as
I knew by your breathing.' 'Oh, I was breathing like
that,' she said, 'to make it jump off.' Here we see
that, somewhat as in the previous cases, the dreamer's
own muscular activity is, during sleep, reconstructed
into the image of an external force; but when she is
in the semi-waking hypnagogic stage, she recognises
that the activity was her own, though still unable to
dismiss the delusion based on the theory formed during
sleep.</p>

<p>At this point we reach the threshold of hallucination,
and the next case to be brought forward may be said to
lie on the threshold, for an impression received in the
hypnagogic (or hypnopompic) stage is accepted in its
illusional form, even when the dreamer is fully awake.
A farmer's daughter&mdash;a bright girl of twenty-one, with
quick nervous reactions, but untrained mind&mdash;dreamed
that she saw her brother (dead some years previously)
with blood streaming from his fingers. She awoke
in a fright, and was comforting herself with the thought
that it was only a dream when she felt a hand grip her
shoulder three times in succession. There was no one
in the room, the door was locked, and no explanation
seemed possible to her. She was very frightened, got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
up at once, dressed, and spent the rest of the night
downstairs working. She was so convinced that a real
hand had touched her that, although it seemed impossible,
she asked her brothers if they had not been playing
a trick on her. The nervous shock was considerable,
and she was unable to sleep well for some weeks afterwards.
She naturally knew nothing about abnormal
psychic phenomena, and was utterly puzzled to explain
the experience, except by supposing that it may have
been a ghost. The explanation is really very simple.
It is well recognised that involuntary muscular twitches
may occur in the shoulder, especially after it has been
subjected to pressure, and that in some cases such
contractions may simulate a touch.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> The dream of a
bleeding hand indicates, when we bear in mind the
tendency to objectify sensations symbolically, now
familiar to us in dreaming, that the dreamer's arm was
probably pressed beneath her in a cramped position.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>
This pressure would account, not only for the dream, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
for the muscular twitches occurring on awakening.
The nature of the dream, the terrified emotional state
it produced, and the mental obscurity of the hypnagogic
state, naturally combined, in a subject unaccustomed
to self-analysis, to create an illusion which
reflection is unable to dispel, though in the normal
waking state she would probably have given no attention
at all to such muscular twitches. Strictly speaking,
such an experience is an illusion&mdash;that is to say, a misinterpretation
of a real sensation&mdash;and not a hallucination&mdash;or
perception without known objective causation&mdash;but
there is no clear line of demarcation. In any
case it may now be taken as proved that hallucinations
tend to occur in the neighbourhood of sleep, and therefore
to partake of the nature of dreams.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>So far we have been concerned with the tendency in
dreams to objectify portions of the body by constructing
out of them new personalities. But precisely the same
process goes on in sleep with regard to our thoughts
and feelings. We split off portions of these also and
construct other personalities out of them, and sometimes
even endow the persons thus formed with thoughts
and feelings more native to our own normal personality
than those which we reserve for ourselves. Thus a
lady who dreamed that when walking with a friend
she discovered a species of animal fruit, a kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
damson containing a snail, expressed her delight at
finding a combination so admirably adapted to culinary
purposes; it was the friend who, retaining the attitude
of her own waking moments, uttered an exclamation
of disgust. Most of the dreams in which there is any
dramatic element are due to this splitting up of personality;
in our dreams we may experience shame or
confusion from the rebukes or the arguments of other
persons, but the persons who administer the rebuke
or apply the argument are still ourselves.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>Some writers on dreaming have marvelled greatly
at this tendency of the sleeping mind to objectify
portions of itself, and so to create imaginary personalities
and evolve dramatic situations. It has seemed
to them quite unaccountable except as the outcome of
a special gift of imagination appertaining to sleep. Yet,
remarkable as it is, this process is simply the inevitable
outcome of the conditions under which psychic life
exists during sleep. If we realise that a more or less
pronounced degree of dissociation of the contents of
the mind occurs during sleep, and if we also realise that,
sleeping fully as much as waking, mind is a thing that
instinctively reasons, and cannot refrain from building
up hypotheses, then we may easily see how the personages
and situations of dreams develop. Much the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
same process might, under some circumstances, occur
in waking life. If, for instance, we heard an unknown
voice speaking behind a curtain, we could not fail to
build up an imaginary person in connection with that
voice, the characteristics of the imaginary person being
largely determined by the nature of the voice and of
the things it uttered: it would, further, be quite easy
to enter into conversation with the person we had thus
constructed. That is what seems to occur in dreams.
We hear a voice behind the curtain of darkness, and to
fit that voice and the things it utters we instinctively
form a picture which, in virtue of the hallucinatory
aptitude of sleep, is thrown against the curtain; it is
then quite easy to enter into conversation with the
person we have thus constructed. It no more occurs
to us during sleep to suppose that the voice we hear is
only a voice and nothing more, than it would occur to
us awake to suppose that the voice behind the curtain
is only a voice and nothing more. The process is the
same; the difference is that in dreams we are, without
knowing it, living among what from the waking point
of view are called hallucinations.</p>

<p>This process by which dreams are formed in sleeping
consciousness through the splitting of the dreamer's
personality for the construction of other personalities
has been recognised ever since dreams began to be
seriously studied. Maury referred to the scission of
personality in dreams.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> Delboeuf dealt with what he
termed the altruising by the dreamer of part of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
representations.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> Foucault terms the same process
personalisation.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Giessler attempts elaborately to explain
the enigma of self-diremption&mdash;the formation of
a secondary self&mdash;in dreams; if, he argues, a touch or
other sensation exceeds the dream-body's capacity of
adaptation&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>, if the state of stimulus is above the
apperceptive threshold&mdash;only one part of the perception
is referred to the dream-body and the other is
transferred to a secondary self.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> This explanation,
while it very fairly covers the presentative class of
dreams, directly connected with sensory stimuli, cannot
so easily be applied to the dramatisation of our representative
dreams, which are not obviously traceable to
direct bodily stimulation.</p>

<p>The splitting up of personality is indeed a very pronounced
and widely extended tendency of the mind,
and has, during recent years, been elaborately studied.
We thus have the basis of that psychic phenomenon
which is variously termed secondary personality, double
personality, duplex personality, multiple personality,
alternation of personality, etc.,<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> and in earlier ages
was regarded as due to possession by demons. Such
conditions seem to be usually associated with hysteria.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
The essential fact about hysteria is, according to Janet,
its lack of synthetising power, which is at the same time
a lack of attention and of apperception, and has as its
result a disintegration of the field of consciousness into
mutually exclusive parts; that is to say, there is a process
of dissociation. Now that is a condition resembling,
as we have seen, the condition found in dreaming. It
is not, therefore, difficult to accept the view of Sollier
and others, that hysteria is a condition allied to sleep,
a condition of vigilambulism in which the patients are
often unable to obtain normal sleep, simply because
they are all the time in a state of abnormal sleep; as
one said to Sollier: 'I cannot sleep because I am
asleep all the time.' It may thus be the case that
hysterical multiple personalities<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> furnish a pathological
analogue of that tendency to the dramatic objectivation
of portions of our personality which is normal and
healthy in dreams.</p>

<p>Similarly in insanity we have an even more constant
and pronounced tendency for the subject to attribute
his own sensations to imaginary individuals, and to
create personalities out of portions of the real personality.
All the illusions, delusions, and hallucinations
of the insane are merely the manifold manifestations
of this tendency. Without it the insanity would not
exist. It is not because he is subjected to unusual
sensations&mdash;visionary, auditory, tactile, olfactory,
visceral, etc.&mdash;that a man is insane. It is because he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
creates imaginary personalities to account for these
sensations; if his food tastes strange some one has
given him <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'posion'">poison</ins> if he hears a strange voice it is some
one communicating with him by telephones or microphones
or hypnotism; if he feels a strange internal
sensation it is perhaps because he has another person
inside him. The case has even been recorded of a man
who attributed any feeling he experienced, even the
most normal sensations of hunger and thirst, to the
people around him. It is exactly the same process as
goes on in our dreams. The sane man, the normal
waking man, may experience all these strange sensations,
but he recognises that they are the spontaneous outcome
of his own organisation.</p>

<p>We may, however, advance a step beyond this
position. This self-objectivation, this dramatisation
of our experiences, is not confined to sleep and to
pathological conditions which resemble sleep. It is
natural and primitive in a far wider sense. The infant
will gaze inquisitively at its own feet, watch their
movements, play with them, 'punish' them; consciousness
has not absorbed them as part of the self.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>
The infant really acts and feels towards the remote
parts of his own body as the adult acts and feels in
dreaming. We are reminded of the generalisation of
Giessler that dream consciousness corresponds to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
normal psychic state in childhood, while sleeping subconsciousness
corresponds to the embryonic psychic
state; so that the dream state represents the
renascence of the ego disentangling itself from the
impersonal sensations and indistinct images of the
embryonic stage of life. That sleeping consciousness is
the primitive embryonic consciousness is, indeed, indicated,
it has often seemed to me, by the fact that in
many animals the embryonic position is the position of
rest and sleep. Ducklings and chicks in the shell have
their heads beneath their wing. The dog lies with his
feet together, head flexed, and hind-quarters drawn up.
Man, alike in the womb and asleep, tends to be curled
up, with the flexors predominating over the extensors.</p>

<p>The savage has gone beyond the infant in ability
to assimilate the impressions of his own limbs, but on
the psychic side he still constantly tends to objectify
his own feelings and ideas, re-creating them as external
beings. Primitive man has done so from the first, and
this impulse has struck its roots into all our most
fundamental human traditions even as they survive
in civilisation to-day. The man of the early world
moves, like the dreamer, among a sea of emotions
and ideas which he cannot recognise the origin of,
and, like the dreamer, he instinctively dramatises them.
But, unlike the dreamer, he gives stability to the images
he has thus created and in good faith mistaken for
independent beings. Thus we have the animistic
stages of culture, and early man peoples his world with
gods and spirits and demons and fairies and ghosts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
which enter into the traditions of his race, and are more
or less accepted even by a later race which no longer
creates them for itself.</p>

<p>In our more advanced civilisations we are still struggling
with later forms of that Protean tendency to
objectify the self and to animate the things and even
the people around us with our own spirit. The impatient
and imperfectly bred child, or even man, kicks
viciously the object he stumbles against, animate or
inanimate, in order to revenge a wrong which exists
only in himself. On a slightly higher plane, the men of
medi&aelig;val times brought actions in the law courts
against offending animals and solemnly pronounced
sentence against them as 'criminals,'<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> while even to-day
society still 'punishes' the human criminal because it
has imaginatively re-created him in the image of an
ordinary normal person, and lacks the intelligence to
perceive that he has been moulded by the laws of his
nature and environment into a creature which we do
well to protect ourselves against, but have no right
to 'punish.'<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> Everywhere we still see around us the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
surviving relics of this primitive tendency of men to
project their own personalities into external objects.
A fine civilisation lies largely in the due subordination
of this tendency, in the realisation and control of our
own emotional possibilities, and in the resultant growth
of personal responsibility.</p>

<p>It is thus impossible to over-estimate the immense
importance of the primitive symbolic tendency to
objectify the subjective. Men have taken out of their
own hearts their best feelings and their worst feelings,
and have personalised and dramatised them, bowed
down to them or stamped on them, unable to hear the
voice with which each of their images spoke: 'I am
thyself.' Our conceptions of religion, of morals, of
many of the mightiest phenomena of life, especially
the more exceptional phenomena, have grown up under
this influence, which still serves to support many
movements of to-day by some people imagined to be
modern.</p>

<p>Dreaming, as we have seen, is not the sole source of
such conceptions. But they could scarcely have been
found convincing, and possibly could not even have
arisen, among races which were wholly devoid of dream
experiences. A large part of all progress in psychological
knowledge, and, indeed, a large part of civilisation
itself, lies in realising that the apparently objective
is really subjective, that the angels and demons and
geniuses of all sorts that once seemed to be external
forces taking possession of feeble and vacant individualities
are themselves but modes of action of marvellously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
rich and varied personalities. In our dreams we
are brought back into the magic circle of early culture,
and we shrink and shudder in the presence of imaginative
phantoms that are built up of our own thoughts
and emotions, and are really our own flesh.</p>

<p>Our memories tend to fall into groups or systems.
We all possess a great number of such systematised
groups of impressions. Every period of life, every subject
we have occupied ourselves with, every intimate
friend we have had, each represents a more or less separate
mass of ideas and feelings. Within each system
one idea or feeling easily calls up another belonging
to the same system. Moreover, in full and alert waking
life, each system is in touch with the systems related to
it. If there crowd into the field of consciousness the
memories belonging to one period of life, or one country
we have lived in, we can control and criticise those
memories by reference to others belonging to another
period or another country. If we are overwhelmed by
the thoughts and emotions associated with the memory
of one friend we can restore our mental balance by
evoking the thoughts and emotions associated with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
another friend. The various systems are in this way
co-ordinated in apperception.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>In sleep, however, these groups are not usually so
firmly held together by the cords along which we can
move in our waking moments from one to the other.
They are, as it were, loosened from their moorings, and
on the sea of sleeping consciousness they drift apart or
jostle together in new and what seem to be random
associations. This is that process of dissociation which
we find so marked in dreaming, and in all those psychic
phenomena&mdash;hallucinations, hysteria, multiple personality,
insanity&mdash;which are allied to dreaming.</p>

<p>A simple illustration of the clash and confusion of
two opposing systems of memories in dreams, when due
apperceptive control is lacking, is supplied by a common
and well-recognised type of dream, the dream of returning
to the school of youth.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> Many people are
occasionally liable to this dream, which is often vivid
and disturbing. We may have left the schoolroom
thirty years or more ago, and never seen it since; it
may have vanished from our waking thoughts. Yet
from time to time we find ourselves there in our dreams,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
and called upon to take our old place, always with a
sense of conflict, a vague discomfort, a feeling of something
incongruous and humiliating, for we realise that
we are now too old. Here is a dream in illustration:
I find myself back at my old school, but my old schoolmaster
is not there; he is away ill, as I am told by his
substitute, whose face somehow seems familiar, though
I cannot recall where I have seen it. I do not know
any of the boys; I am returning after an absence of
some months. I realise that I am to take my old place
again, and yet I feel a profound repulsion to do so,
a sense that it is somehow incongruous. This latter
feeling seems to prevail, for I finally assume the part
of a visitor, and remark, insincerely, to the master that
it is pleasant to see the old place again.</p>

<p>In such a case as this it seems that a picture from an
ancient system of memories floats across the field of
sleeping consciousness, and the dreamer is naturally
drawn into that system and begins to adapt himself
to its demands. But, as he does so, the influence of
other later and incompatible systems of memories
begins unconsciously to affect the dreamer.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> The cords
of connection, however, which when awake would
enable him to adjust critically the opposing systems,
are not acting; apperception is defective. Yet the
opposing systems are there, outside the immediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
field of consciousness, and jostling the ancient system
which has come into the central focus. Finally this
jostling of the ancient system by more recent systems
causes a harmonising modification in consciousness.
The dreamer ceases to be a boy in his old school, and
assumes the part of a visitor.</p>

<p>Dreams of our recently dead friends furnish a type of
dream which is formed in exactly the same way as these
dreams of a return to school life. The only difference
is that they often present it in a more vivid, pronounced,
and poignantly emotional shape. This is so, partly
from the very subject of such dreams, and partly
because the fact of death definitely divides our impressions
of our dead friends into two groups, which are
intimately allied to each other by their subject, and yet
absolutely opposed by the fact that in the one group
the friend is alive, and in the other dead.</p>

<p>I proceed to present two series of dreams&mdash;one in a
man, the other in a woman&mdash;illustrating this type of
dream.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p><em>Observation I.</em>&mdash;Mr. C., age about twenty-eight, a
man of scientific training and aptitudes. Shortly
after his mother's death he repeatedly dreamed that
she had come to life again. She had been buried, but
it was somehow found out that she was not really dead.
Mr. C. describes the painful intellectual struggles that
went on in these dreams, the arguments in favour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
death from the impossibility of prolonged life in the
grave, and how these doubts were finally swallowed
up in a sense of wonder and joy because his mother was
actually there, alive, in his dream.</p>

<p>These dreams became less frequent as time went on,
but some years later occurred an isolated dream which
clearly shows a further stage in the same process. Mr.
C. dreamed that his father had just returned home, and
that he (the dreamer) was puzzled to make out where
his mother was. After puzzling a long time he asked
his sister, but at the very moment he asked it flashed
upon him&mdash;more, he thinks, with a feeling of relief at
the solution of a painful difficulty than with grief&mdash;that
his mother was dead.</p>

<p><em>Observation II.</em>&mdash;Mrs. F., age about thirty, highly
intelligent but of somewhat emotional temperament.
A week after the death of a lifelong friend to whom she
was greatly attached, Mrs. F. dreamed for the first time
of her friend, finding that she was alive, and then in
the course of the dream discovering that she had been
buried alive.</p>

<p>A second dream occurred on the following night.
Mrs. F. imagined that she went to see her friend, whom
she found in bed, and to whom she told the strange
things that she had heard (<em>i.e.</em>, that the friend was dead).
Her friend then gave Mrs. F. a few things as souvenirs.
But on leaving the room Mrs. F. was told that her friend
was really dead, and had spoken to her after death.</p>

<p>In a fourth dream, at a subsequent date, Mrs. F.
imagined that her friend came to her, saying that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
had returned to earth for a few minutes to give her
messages and to assure her that she was happy in another
world and in the enjoyment of the fullest life.</p>

<p>Another dream occurred more than a year later.
Some one brought to Mrs. F., in her dream, the news
that her friend was still alive; she was taken to her
and found her as in life. The friend said she had been
away, but did not explain where or why she had been
supposed dead. Mrs. F. asked no questions and felt
no curiosity, being absorbed in the joy of finding her
friend still alive, and they proceeded to talk over the
things that had happened since they last met. It was
a very vivid, natural, and detailed dream, and on
awaking Mrs. F. felt somewhat exhausted. Although
not superstitious, the dream gave her a feeling of
consolation.</p>

<p>The next series has been observed more recently.
I include all the dreams and the intervals at which
they occurred. The somewhat unexpected news reached
me of the death of a near and lifelong friend when I was
myself recovering from an attack of influenza. No
dream which could be connected with this event occurred
until about a fortnight later<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> (16th January).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
I then dreamed that I was with my friend and asking
him (he had been a clergyman and Biblical scholar)
whether, in his opinion, Jesus had been able to speak
Greek. I awoke before I received his answer, but no
sort of doubt, hesitation, or surprise was aroused by
his appearance alive.</p>

<p>Nineteen days later (4th February) occurred the
next dream. This time I dreamed that my friend was
just dead, and that I was gazing at a postcard of good
wishes, written partly in Latin, which he had sent me
a few days before (on the actual date of my birthday),
and regretting that I had not answered it. There
was no doubt in my mind as to the fact of his death.
(I may remark that the last letter I had written to my
friend was on his birthday, and he had been unable to
reply, so that there was here one of those reversals
which Freud and others have noted as not uncommon
in dreams.)</p>

<p>The next dream occurred thirty-four days later
(10th March). I thought that I met my friend, and at
once realised that it was not he but his wife who had
died, and I clasped his hand sympathetically.</p>

<p>Some months later (27th July) I again dreamed that
I was walking with my friend and talking, as we might
have talked, on topics of common interest. But at
the same time I knew, and he knew that I knew, that
he was to die on the morrow.</p>

<p>Once more, a fortnight later (10th August), I dreamed
that I had an appointment to meet my friend in a certain
road, but he failed to appear. I began to wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
whether he had forgotten the appointment, or I had
made a mistake, and I was seeking for the letter making
the appointment when I awoke.</p>

<p>It would appear that the dreams of this type are less
pronounced in the ratio of the less pronounced affectional
intensity of the relationship which unites the
friends. The next dream concerned a man for whom
I had the highest esteem and regard, but had not been
intimately associated with. I dreamed that I saw this
friend, who was the editor of a psychological journal,
alive and well in his room, together with two foreign
psychologists also known to me, who had apparently
succeeded him in the editorship of the journal, for I
saw their names on the title-page of a number of it
which was put in my hands. It surprised me that,
though alive and well, he should have ceased to edit
the journal; the theory by which I satisfactorily
accounted to myself for his appearance was that, though
he had been so near death that his life was despaired of,
he had not actually died; his death had been prematurely
reported. It flashed across my dream consciousness,
indeed, that I had read obituaries of my friend
in the papers, but this reminiscence merely suggested
the reflection that some one had been guilty of a grave
indiscretion.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>Although no attempt had been made to analyse this
type of dream before 1895, the dream itself had often
been noted down, as from its poignant and affecting
character it could not fail to be. An early example is
furnished by the philosopher Gassendi, who states that
he dreamed he met a friend, that he greeted him as one
returned from the dead, and that then, saying to himself
in his dream that this was impossible, he concluded
that he must be dreaming.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> Pepys, again, in his <cite>Diary</cite>,
on the 29th June 1667, a few months after his mother's
death, dreamed that 'my mother told me she lacked a
pair of gloves, and I remembered a pair of my wife's in
my chamber, and resolved she should have them,
but then recollected [reflected] how my mother came to
be here when I was in mourning for her, and so thinking
it to be a mistake in our thinking her all this while dead,
I did contrive that it should be said to any that inquired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
that it was my mother-in-law, my wife's mother,
that was dead, and we in mourning for.' This dream,
Pepys adds, 'did trouble me mightily.' Edmond de
Goncourt, in his <cite>Journal</cite> (27th July 1870), well describes
how in the first dream of the dead brother to whom he
was so tenderly attached, the two streams of memories
appeared. He dreamed he was walking with his
brother, but at the same time he knew he was in mourning
for him, and friends were coming up to offer condolences;
the emotions caused by the conflict of these
two certainties&mdash;his brother's life affirmed by his
presence and his death affirmed by all the other circumstances
of the dream&mdash;was profoundly distressing.
A few years earlier Renan, when his dearly loved sister
Henrietta died by his side in the Lebanon, also had
dreams of this type, which deeply affected even his
cautious and sceptical nature. She had died of Syrian
fever, from which he also was suffering, and shortly
afterwards he wrote in a letter that 'in feverish dreams
a terrible doubt has risen up before me; I have fancied
I heard her voice calling to me from the vault where she
was laid.' He comforted himself, however, with the
thought that this horrible supposition was unjustified,
since French doctors had been present at her death.
Maury<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> also mentions that he had often had dreams of
this type in which the dead appeared as living, though
the sight of them always produced astonishment and
doubt which the sleeping brain endeavoured to allay
by some kind of explanation. Beaunis also describes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
how he has dreamed with surprise of meeting a friend
whom even in his dream he knew to be dead.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p>It is not difficult, in the light of all that we have been
able to learn regarding the psychology of the world of
dreams, to account for the process here described, for
its frequency, and for its poignant emotional effects.
This dream type is only a special variety of the
commonest species of dream, in which two or more
groups of reminiscences flow together and form a single
bizarre congruity, a <em>confusion</em> in the strict sense of the
word. The death of a friend sets up a barrier which
cuts into two the stream of impressions concerning that
friend. Thus, two streams of images flow into sleeping
consciousness, one representing the friend as alive, the
other as dead. The first stream comes from older and
richer sources; the second is more poignant, but also
more recent and more easily exhausted. The two
streams break against each other in restless conflict,
both, from the inevitable conditions of dream life,
being accepted as true, and they eventually mix to form
an absurd harmony, in which the older and stronger
images (in accordance with that recognised tendency
for old psychic impressions generally to be most stable)
predominate over those that are more recent. Thus,
in the first observation the dreamer seems to have
begun his dream by imagining that his mother was
alive as of old; then his more recent experiences
interfered with the assertion of her death. This
resulted in a struggle between the old-established<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
images representing her as alive and the later ones
representing her as dead. The idea that she had come
to life again was evidently a theory that had arisen in
his brain to harmonise these two opposing currents.
The theory was not accepted easily; all sorts of scientific
objections arose to oppose it, but there could be no
doubt, for his mother was there. The dreamer is in
the same position as a paranoiac who constantly seems
to hear threatening voices; henceforth he is absorbed
in inventing a theory (electricity, hypnotism, or whatever
it may be) to account for his hallucinations, and
his whole view of life is modified accordingly. The
dreamer, in the cases I am here concerned with, sees
an image of the dead person as alive, and is therefore
compelled to invent a theory to account for this image;
the theories that most easily suggest themselves are
either that the dead person has never really died, or
else that he has come back from the dead for a brief
space. The mental and emotional conflict which such
dreams involve renders them very vivid. They make
a profound impression even after awakening, and for
some sensitive persons are almost too sacred to speak of.</p>

<p>When a series of these dreams occurs concerning the
same dead friend the tendency seems to be, on the
whole&mdash;though there are certainly many exceptions&mdash;for
the living reality of the vision of the dead friend
to be more and more positively affirmed. Whether
awake or asleep, it is very difficult for us to resist the
evidence of our senses. It is even more difficult asleep
than awake, for, as we have seen reason to believe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
apperception, with the critical control it involves, is
weakened. Just as the savage or the child accepts as
a reality the illusion of the sun traversing the sky,
just as the paranoiac accepts the reality of the hallucinations
he is subjected to, and gradually weaves them
into a more or less plausible theory, so the dreamer
seems to employ all the acutest powers of sleeping
reason available to construct a theory in support of
the reality of the visions of his dead friend.</p>

<p>Sometimes atypical dreams of the dead occur in which
even from the first there appears little clash or doubt.
When the vision can thus easily be accepted, it is sometimes
a source of consolation, joy, and even religious
faith which may still persist in the waking state.
Chabaneix has, for instance, recorded the dream experiences
of a poet and philosopher who had been
deeply attached to a woman with whom his relations
were both passionate and intellectual. From the
night after her death onwards, at intervals, he had
dreams of the beloved woman, at first appearing as a
floating vision, later as a vividly seen and tangible
person; these dreams caused refreshment and mental
invigoration, and seemed to bring the dreamer into
renewed communication with his dead friend.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>I am indebted to a clergyman for the record of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
somewhat similar experience. 'A close friendship,'
he writes, 'once existed between myself and a lady,
somewhat older, and of a religious temperament. We
often discussed the life beyond the grave, and agreed
that if she died first, and this appeared more than
probable, as she was the victim of a mortal disease, she
would appear to me. I may add that she was of a
highly-strung and nervous nature, and though purely
English had many of the psychic characteristics of
the Celt. After her death, I looked for some appearance
or manifestation, and about three days after dreamed
that she had come back to me, and was discussing with
me a matter which I much wished to speak about before
her death, but was unable to, owing to her weakness
and the presence of strangers. In the dream it was
perfectly clear to me that she was a dead woman back
from another sphere of existence. For some weeks
after this I had similar experiences. They were never
dreams of the old life and friendship before death, but
always reappearances from the other world. Of course
it may be said of this experience of mine, that it was
merely the result of expectation. But I have found
that the things most on my mind are rarely the subject
of my dreams. Moreover, these dreams formed a
series, lasting for weeks, and all of the same character,
though the conversations differed.'</p>

<p>When a dreamer awakes in an emotional state which
corresponds to a dream he has just experienced, it is
usually a safe assumption that the dream was the result,
and not the cause, of the emotional state. That is by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
no means always the case, however, and in the type of
dream we are here concerned with it is rarely the case.
Even though it may be quite true that an emotional state
evoked the dream, it is equally true that in its turn the
dream itself may arouse an emotional state. The
dream of encountering a celestial visitant, especially
if the visitant is a beloved friend, cannot fail to produce
an especial effect of this kind. It is noteworthy
that the emotional influence may be present even when
the fact of dreaming has not been recalled. Thus a
lady who, on waking in the morning could not remember
having dreamed, realised during the day that
she was feeling as she was accustomed to feel after
dreaming of a beloved friend, and was ultimately able
to recall fragments of the dream.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> A man of so great
an intellect as Goethe has borne witness to the consoling
influence of dreams. 'I have had times in my life,'
he said, in old age, to Eckermann, 'when I have fallen
asleep in tears, but in my dreams the loveliest figures
come to give me comfort and happiness, and I awake
next morning once more fresh and cheerful.'<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>If we take a wide sweep we shall find in many
parts of the world stories and legends concerning
the relationship of the living with the dead which
have a singular resemblance with the typical dream
of the dead here investigated. Thus, in Japan, it
appears that stories of the returning of the dead are
very common. Lafcadio Hearn reproduces one, as
told by a Japanese, which closely resembles some
of the dreams we have met with. 'A lover resolved
to commit suicide on the grave of his sweetheart.
He found her tomb and knelt before it, and prayed
and wept, and whispered to her that which he was
about to do. And suddenly he heard her voice cry
to him "Anata!" and felt her hand upon his hand:
and he turned and saw her kneeling beside him, smiling
and beautiful as he remembered her, only a little pale.
Then his heart leaped so that he could not speak for
the wonder and the doubt and the joy of that moment.
But she said, "Do not doubt; it is really I. I am not
dead. It was all a mistake. I was buried because my
parents thought me dead&mdash;buried too soon. Yet you
see I am not dead, not a ghost. It is I; do not doubt
it!"' It is perhaps worth mentioning that the
incident told in the Fourth Gospel (xx. 11-18) as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
occurring to Mary Magdalene when at the tomb of
Jesus, recalls the dream process of fusion of images.
She turns and sees, as she thinks, the gardener, but in
the course of conversation it flashes on her that he is
Jesus, risen from the tomb. In quite another part of
the world the Salish Indians of British Columbia have
a story of a man who goes back to the spirit-world to
reclaim his lost wife; this can only be done under
special conditions, and for some time refraining to
touch her; if he breaks these conditions she vanishes
in his arms, and he is left alone.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> That story, again,
cannot fail to remind us of the almost identical Greek
legend of the return of Orpheus to the under-world to
reclaim his dead wife Eurydice. If these myths and
legends were not directly based on the dream-process,
it can only be on the ground, alleged with some
force by Freud's school, that myths and legends
themselves develop by means of the same mechanism
as dreams.</p>

<p>The probable influence of dreams in originating or
confirming the primitive belief of men in a spirit world
has often been set forth. Herbert Spencer attached
great importance to this factor in the constitution of the
belief in another world, in spirits and in gods.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> Wundt
even considers that such dreams furnish the whole
origin of animism. Other writers, less closely associated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
with anthropological psychology, have argued in
the same sense.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>But while these thinkers have in some cases specifically
referred to dreams of the dead, and not merely
to the widespread belief of savages that in sleep the
soul leaves the body to wander over the earth, they
have never realised that there is a special mechanism
in the typical dream of a dead friend, due to mental
dissociation during sleep, which powerfully suggests to
us that death sets up no fatal barrier to the return of the
dead. In dreams the dead are thus rendered indestructible;
they cannot be finally killed, but rather tend to
reappear in ever more clearly affirmed vitality. Dreams
of this sort must certainly have come to men ever since
men began to be. If their emotional effects are great
to-day, we can well believe that they were much greater
in the early days when dream life and what we call real
life were less easily distinguished. The repercussion
of this kind of dream through unmeasured ages cannot
fail to have told at last on the traditions of the race.</p>

<p>The peculiarities of memory in dreams&mdash;its defects,
its aberrations, its excesses&mdash;have attracted attention
ever since dreams began to be studied at all. It is not
enough to assure ourselves that on awakening from
a dream our memory of that dream may fairly be regarded
as trustworthy so far as it extends. The
characteristics of memory revealed within the reproduced
dream have sometimes seemed so extraordinary
as to be only explicable by the theory of supernatural
intervention.</p>

<p>A problem which at one time greatly puzzled the
scientific students of dreaming is furnished at the outset<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
by the apparent abnormal rapidity of the dream process,
the piling together in a brief space of time of a great
number of combined memories. Stories were told of
people who, when awakened by sounds or contacts
which must have aroused them almost immediately,
had yet experienced elaborate visions which could only
have been excited by the stimulus which caused the
awakening. The dream of Maury&mdash;who, when
awakened by a portion of the bed cornice falling on his
neck, imagined that he was living in the days of the
Reign of Terror, and, after many adventures, was
being guillotined&mdash;has become famous.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>It is unquestionably true that dreams are sometimes
evoked by sensory stimuli which almost immediately
awake the dreamer. But the supposition that this
fairly common fact involves an extraordinary acceleration
of the rapidity with which mental images are formed
is due to a failure to comprehend the conditions under
which psychic activity in sleep takes place. If the
sleeper were wide awake, and were suddenly startled
by a mysterious voice at the window or the door, he
would arrive at a theory of the sound, and even form a
plan of action, with at least as much rapidity as when
the stimulus occurs during sleep. The difference is
that in sleep the ordinary mental associations are more
or less in abeyance, and the way is therefore easily open
to new associations. These new associations, when we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
look back at them from the standpoint of waking life,
seem to us so bizarre, so far-fetched, that we think it
must have required a long time to imagine them. We
fail to realise that, under the conditions of dream
thought, they have come about as automatically and
as instantaneously as the ordinary psychic <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'concommitants'">concomitants</ins>
of external stimulation in waking life. It must
also be remembered that in all the cases in which the
rapidity of the dream process has seemed so extraordinary,
it has merely been a question of visual imagery,
and it is obviously quite easy to see in an instant an
elaborate picture or series of pictures which would take
a long time to describe.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> At the most the dreamer
has merely seen a kind of cinematographic drama
which has been condensed and run together in very
much the way practised by the cinematographic artist,
so that although the whole story seems to be shown in
constant movement, in reality the action of hours is
condensed into moments. Further, it has always to
be borne in mind that, asleep as well as awake, intense
emotion involves a loss of the sense of time. We say
in a terrible crisis that moments seemed years, and
when sleeping consciousness magnifies a trivial stimulation
into the occasion of a great crisis the same effect
is necessarily produced.</p>

<p>Exactly the same illusion is experienced by persons
who are rescued from drowning, or other dangerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
situations. It sometimes seems to them that their
whole life has passed before them in vision during those
brief moments. But careful investigation of some of
these cases, notably by Pi&eacute;ron, has shown that what
really happened was that a scene from childhood,
perhaps of some rather similar accident, came before
the drowning man's mind and was followed by five,
six, perhaps even ten or twelve momentary scenes from
later life. When the time during which these scenes
flashed through the mind was taken into account it
was found that there had by no means been any
remarkable mental rapidity.</p>

<p>Such considerations have now led most scientific
investigators of dreaming to regard these problems of
dream memory as settled. Woodworth's observations
on the hypnagogic or half-waking state revealed no
remarkable rapidity of mental processes. Clavi&egrave;re
showed by experiments with an <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'alarum'">alarm</ins> clock which
struck twice with an interval of twenty-two seconds
that speech dreams at all events take place merely with
normal rapidity, or are even slightly slower than under
waking conditions. The imagery of sleep, Clavi&egrave;re
concluded, is not more rapid than the imagery of waking
life, though to the dreamer it may seem to last for hours
or days. It is often slackened rather than accelerated,
says Pi&eacute;ron, who refers to the corresponding illusion
under the influence of drugs like <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'hashisch'">hashish</ins>, though in
some cases he finds that there is really a slight acceleration.
The illusion is simply due, Foucault thinks, to
the dreamer's belief that the events of his dream occupy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
the same time as real events. This illusion of time,
concludes Dr. Justine Tobolowska, in her Paris thesis
on this subject, is simply the necessary and constant
result of the form assumed by psychic life during
sleep.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>If this peculiarity of memory in dreaming is not
difficult to explain as a natural illusion, there are other
and rarer characteristics of dream memory which are
much more puzzling.</p>

<p>In attempting to unravel these, it is probable that,
as in explaining the illusion of rapidity, we must always
bear in mind the tendency of memory-groups in dreams
to fall apart from their waking links of association,
so well as the complementary tendency to form associations
which in waking life would only be attained by a
strained effort. Apperception, with the power it involves
of combining and bringing to a focus all the
various groups of memories bearing on the point in
hand, is defective. The focus of conscious attention
is contracted, and there is the curious and significant
phenomenon that sleeping consciousness is occasionally
unconscious of psychic elements which yet are present
just outside it and thrusting imagery into its focus.
The imagery becomes conscious, but its relation to the
existing focus of consciousness is not consciously perceived.
Such a psychic mechanism, as Freud and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
disciples have shown, quite commonly appears in
hysteria and obsessional neuroses when healthy normal
consciousness is degraded to a pathological level resembling
that which is normal in dreams.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> In such a
case the surface of sleeping consciousness is, as it were,
crumpled up, and the concealed portion appears only at
the end of the dream or not at all. A simple example
may make this clear. In a dream I ask a lady if she
knows the work of the poet Bau; she replies that she
does not; then I see before me a paper having on it
the name Baudelaire, clearly the name which should
have been contained in my query.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> In such a dream
the crumpling and breaking of consciousness, at its very
focus, is shown in the most unmistakable manner.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>
But many of the most remarkable dreams of dramatic
dreamers are due to the same phenomenon, which in
an intellectual form is exactly the phenomenon which
always makes a dramatic situation effective. Robert
Louis Stevenson was an abnormally vivid dreamer,
and found the germ of some of the plots of his stories
in his dreams; he has described one of his dreams in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
which the dreamer imagines he has committed a murder;
the crime becomes known to a woman who, however,
never denounces it; the murderer lives in terror, and
cannot conceive why the woman prolongs his torture
by this delay in giving him up to justice; only at the
end of the dream comes the clue to the mystery, and the
explanation of the woman's attitude, as she falls on her
knees and cries: 'Do you not understand? I love
you.'<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>There is another and very interesting class of dreams
in which we find not merely that some memory-groups
disappear from consciousness or become merely latent,
but also that other memory-groups, latent or even lost
to waking consciousness, float into the focus of sleeping
consciousness. In other words, we can remember in
sleep what we have forgotten awake. We then have
what is called the <em>hypermnesia</em>, the excessive or abnormal
memory, of sleep.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that the two processes&mdash;the
sinking of some memory-groups and the emergence
on the surface of other memory-groups which, so far as
waking life is concerned, had apparently fallen to the
depths and been drowned&mdash;are complementarily related
to one another. We remember what we have
forgotten because we forget what we remembered.
The order of our waking impressions involves a certain
tension, that is to say a certain attention, which holds
them in our consciousness, and excludes any other
order which might serve to bring lost memory-groups<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
to sight. Sometimes we are conscious of a lost memory
which is just outside consciousness, but which, with
the existing order of our memory-groups, we cannot
bring into consciousness. We have the missing name,
the missing memory, at the tip of our tongue, we say,
but we cannot quite catch it.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> In dreams apperception
is defective, the strain of conscious attention is relaxed,
and the conditions are furnished under which new clues
and strains may come into action and the missing name
glide spontaneously into consciousness. Even the mere
approach of sleep, with its accompanying relaxation of
attention, may effect this end. Thus I was trying one
day to recall the name of the unpleasant Chinese scent,
patchouli. The name, though not usually unfamiliar,
escaped me. At night, however, just before falling
asleep, it spontaneously occurred to me. In the morning,
when fully awake, I was again unable to recall it.</p>

<p>In such a case we see how waking consciousness is
tense in a certain direction, which happens not to be
that in which the desired thing is to be found. Attention
under such circumstances impedes rather than
aids recollection. In this particular case, I felt convinced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
that the name I wanted began with <em>h</em>, and thus
my mind was intently directed towards a wrong quarter.
But on the approach of sleep attention is automatically
relaxed, and it is then possible for the forgotten
word to slip in from its unexpected quarter. On
these occasions it is by indirection that direction is
found.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>It is interesting to observe that this same process of
discovery due to the wider outlook of relaxed attention
can take place, not only in sleep and the hypnagogic
state, but also, subconsciously, in the fully waking
state when the mind is occupied with some other subject.
Thus in reading a MS., I came upon an illegible word
which I was unable to identify, notwithstanding several
guesses and careful scrutiny through a magnifying
glass. I passed on, dismissing the subject from my
mind. A quarter of an hour afterwards, when walking,
and thinking of quite a different subject, I became
conscious that the word 'ceremonial' had floated into
the field of mental vision, and I at once realised that
this was the unidentified word. The instance may be
trivial, but no example could better show how the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
mind may continue to work subconsciously in one
direction while consciously working in an entirely
different direction.</p>

<p>In dreams, however, we can effect more than a mere
recovery of memories which have temporarily escaped
us, or the discovery of relationships which have eluded
us. The dissociation of familiar memory-groups becomes
so complete, the appearance of unfamiliar groups
so eruptive, that we can remember things that have
entirely and permanently sunk below the surface of
waking consciousness, or even things which are so
insignificant that they have never made any mark
on waking consciousness at all. In this way, we may
be said, in a certain sense, to remember things we never
knew. The first dream which enabled me, some twenty
years ago, to realise this hypermnesia of the mind in
dreams<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> was the following unimportant but instructive
case. I woke up recalling the chief items of a rather
vivid dream: I had imagined myself in a large old
house, where the furniture, though of good quality,
was ancient, and the chairs threatened to give way
as one sat on them. The place belonged to one Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Peter Bryan, a hale old gentleman, who was accompanied
by his son and grandson. There was a question of my
buying the place from him, and I was very complimentary
to the old gentleman's appearance of youthfulness,
absurdly affecting not to know which was the
grandfather and which the grandson. On awaking
I said to myself that here was a purely imaginative
dream, quite unsuggested by any definite experiences.
But when I began to recall the trifling incidents of the
previous day, and the things I had seen and read, I
realised that that was far from being the case. So far
from the dream having been a pure effort of imagination,
I found that every minute item could be traced
to some separate source, though none of them had the
slightest resemblance to the dream as a whole. The
name of Sir Peter Bryan alone completely baffled me;
I could not even recall that I had at that time ever heard
of any one called Bryan. I abandoned the search and
made my notes of the dream and its sources. I had
scarcely done so when I chanced to take up a volume
of biographies of eccentric personages, which I had
glanced through carelessly the day before. I found
that it contained, among others, the lives of Lord
<em>Peter</em>borough and George <em>Bryan</em> Brummel. I had
certainly seen those names the day before; yet before
I took up the book once again it would have been
impossible for me to recall the exact name of
Beau Brummel. It so happened that the forgotten
memory which in this case re-emerged to sleeping consciousness,
was a fact of no consequence to myself or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
any one else. But it furnishes the key to many
dreams which have been of more serious import to the
dreamers.</p>

<p>Since then I have been able to observe among my
friends several instances of dreams containing veracious
though often trivial circumstances unknown to the
dreamer when awake, though on consideration it was
found to be in the highest degree probable that they had
come under his notice, and been forgotten, or not
consciously observed. Thus a musical correspondent
tells me he once dreamed of playing a piece of Rubinstein's
in the presence of a friend who told him he had
made a mistake in re-striking a tied note. In the
morning he found the dream friend was correct. But
up to then he had always repeated the note. Usually
when the forgotten or unnoticed circumstance is trivial,
it is of quite recent date. That it is not always very
recent may be illustrated by a dream of my own. I
dreamed that I was in Spain and about to rejoin some
friends at a place which was called, I thought, Daraus,
but on reaching the booking-office I could not remember
whether the place I wanted to go to was called Daraus,
Varaus, or Zaraus, all which places, it seemed to me, really
existed. On awaking, I made a note of the dream,
exactly as reproduced here, but was unable to recall
any place, in Spain or elsewhere, corresponding to any
of these names. The dream seemed merely to illustrate
the familiar way in which a dream image perpetually
shifts in a meaningless fashion at the focus of sleeping
consciousness. The note was put away, and a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
months later taken out again.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> It was still equally
impossible to me to recall any real name corresponding
to the dream names. But on consulting the Spanish
guide-books and railway time-tables, I found that, on
the line between San Sebastian and Bilbao, there really
is a little seaside resort, in a beautiful situation, called
Zarauz, and I realised, moreover, that I had actually
passed that station in the train two hundred and fifty
days before the date of my dream.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> I had no associations
with this place, though I may have admired it at
the time; in any case it vanished permanently from
conscious memory, perhaps aided by the fatigue of a
long night journey before entering Spain. Even sleeping
memory, I may remark, only recovered it with an
effort, for it is notable that the name was gradually
approached by three successive attempts.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>A special form of lost or unconscious memories recurring
in sleep is constituted by the cases in which
people when asleep, or in a somnambulistic state, can
speak languages which they have forgotten, or never
consciously known, when awake. A simple instance,
known to me, is furnished by a servant who had been
taken to Paris for a few weeks six months before, but
had never learned to speak a word of French, and whose
mistress overheard her talking in her sleep, and repeating
various French phrases, like 'Je ne sais pas, Monsieur';
she had certainly heard these phrases, though she maintained,
when awake, that she was ignorant of them.
Speaking in a language not consciously known, or
xenoglossia, as it is now termed, occurs under various
abnormal conditions, as well as in sleep, and is sometimes
classed with the tendency which is found, especially
under great religious excitement, to 'speak with
tongues,' or to utter gibberish.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> But in various sleep-like
states it occurs as a true revival of forgotten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
memories, sometimes of memories which belong to childhood
and in normal consciousness have been long
overlaid and lost. On one occasion, by the bedside of
a lady who was kept for a considerable period in a light
condition of chloroform anaesthesia, the patient began
to talk in an unfamiliar language which one of us
recognised as Welsh; as a child, she afterwards owned,
she had known Welsh, but had long since forgotten it.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>
A similar reproduction of lost memories occurs in the
hypnotic state.</p>

<p>This psychic process, by which unconscious memories
become conscious in dreams, is of considerable interest
and importance because it lends itself to many delusions.
Not only the ignorant and uncultured, but
even well-trained and acute minds, are often so unskilled
in mental analysis that they are quite unable
to pierce beneath the phenomenon of conscious ignorance
to the deeper fact of unconscious memory; they
are completely baffled, or else they resort to the wildest
hypotheses. This is illustrated by the following
narrative received twelve years ago from a medical
correspondent in Baltimore. 'Several years ago,' he
writes, 'a friend made a social call at my house and in
the course of conversation spoke very enthusiastically
of Mascagni's <cite>Cavalleria Rusticana</cite>, the first performance
of which in the United States he had attended
a few nights previously. I had never even heard of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
the opera before, but that night I dreamed that I heard
it performed. The dream was a very vivid one, so
vivid that several times during the next day I found
myself humming airs from the dream opera. Several
evenings later I went to the theatre to see a comedy,
and before the curtain rose the orchestra played a
selection which I instantly recognised as part of my
dream opera. I exclaimed to a lady who was with me:
"That selection is from <cite>Cavalleria Rusticana</cite>." On
inquiring of the leader of the orchestra such proved
to be the case.' Now, at that period, shortly after the
first appearance of <cite>Cavalleria Rusticana</cite>, portions of it
had become extremely popular and were heard everywhere,
by no means merely on the operatic stage. It
was difficult not to have heard something of it. There
cannot be the slightest doubt that my correspondent
had heard not only the name but the music, though,
writing at an interval of some years, he probably
exaggerated the extent of his unconscious recollections.
This seems the simple explanation of what to my
correspondent was an inexplicable mystery. Other
people, like the late Frederick Greenwood, not content
to remain baffled, go further and regard such dreams
as 'dreams of revelation,' as they also consider that
class of dreams in which the dreamer works out the
solution of a difficulty which he had vainly grappled
with when awake.</p>

<p>This is a kind of dream which has occurred in all
ages, and has at times been put down to divine interposition.
Sixteen centuries ago Bishop Synesius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
of Ptolemais wrote that in his hunting days a dream
revealed to him an idea for a trap which he successfully
employed in snaring animals, and at the present time
inventions made in dreams have been successfully
patented. The Rev. Nehemiah Curnock, who lately
succeeded in deciphering Wesley's <cite>Journal</cite>, has stated
that an important missing clue to the cypher came to
him in a dream. A friend of my own, an expert in
chemistry, was not long since in frequent communication
with a practical manufacturer, assisting him
in his inventions by scientific advice. One day the
manufacturer wrote to my friend asking if the latter
had been thinking of him during the night, for he had
been much puzzled by a difficulty, and during the night
had seen a vision of my friend who explained the solution
of the difficulty; in the morning the proposed
solution proved successful. There was, however, no
telepathic element in the case; the dreamer's solution
was his own.</p>

<p>An interesting group of cases in this class is furnished
by the dreams in which the dreamer, in opposition to
his waking judgment, sees an acquaintance in whom
he reposes trust acting in a manner unworthy of that
trust, subsequent events proving that the estimate
formed during sleep was sounder than that of waking
life. Hawthorne (in his <cite>American Notebooks</cite>), Greenwood,
Jewell, and others have recorded cases of this
kind.</p>

<p>Various as these phenomena are, they fall into the
same scheme. They all help to illustrate the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
though on one side mental life in sleep is feeble and
defective, on the other side it shows a tendency to
vigorous excess. Sleep, as we know, involves a relaxation
of tension, both physical and psychic; attention
is no longer focused at a deliberately selected spot.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>
The voluntary field becomes narrower, but the involuntary
field becomes extended. Thus it happens
that the contents of our minds fall into a new order,
an order which is often fantastic but, on the other
hand, is sometimes a more natural and even a more
rational order than that we attain in waking life.
Our eyes close, our muscles grow slack, the reins fall
from our hands. But it sometimes happens that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
horse knows the road home even better than we know
it ourselves.</p>

<p>Hypermnesia, or abnormally wide range of recollection,
is not the only or the most common modification
of memory during sleep. We find much more commonly,
and indeed as one of the chief characteristics of sleep,
an abnormally narrow range of recollection. We find,
also, and perhaps as a result of that narrow range,
paramnesia or perversion of memory. The best known
form of paramnesia is that in which we have the illusion
that the event which is at the moment happening to us
has happened to us before.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>This form of paramnesia is common in dreams, though
it is often so slightly pronounced that we either fail to
recall it on awakening or attach no significance to it.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>
I dream, for instance, that I am walking along a path,
along which, it seems to me, I have often walked before,
and that the path skirts the lawn of a house by which
stands a policeman whom, also, it seems to me, I have
often seen there before; the policeman approaches me
and says, 'You have come to see Mr. So-and-so, sir?'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
and thereupon I suddenly recollect, with some confusion,
that I have come to see Mr. So-and-so, and I
walk up to the door. Again, an author dreams that he
sees a list of his own books with, at the head of them,
one entitled 'The Book of Glory.' He could not
recall writing it (and to waking consciousness the name
was entirely unknown), but the only reflection he made
in his dream was 'How stupid to have forgotten!'
In this case there was evidently some resistance to the
suggestion, which yet was quickly accepted. In all
such dreams it seems that we are in a state of mental
weakness associated with defective apperceptual control
and undue suggestibility, very similar to the state
found in some forms of confusional insanity or of
precocious dementia.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> Consciousness feebly slides
down the path of least resistance; it accepts every
suggestion; the objects presented to it seem things
that it knew before, the things that are suggested to it
to do seem things that it already wanted to do before.
Paramnesia, thus regarded, seems simply a natural
outcome of a state of consciousness temporarily depressed
below its normal standard of vigour.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that the suggestibility of
sleeping consciousness varies in degree, and in the face
of serious improbabilities there is often a considerable
amount of resistance, just as the hypnotised person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
seriously resists the suggestions that fundamentally
outrage his nature. But some degree of suggestibility,
some tendency to regard the things that come before
us in dreams as familiar&mdash;in other words, as things that
have happened to us before&mdash;is not merely a natural
result of defective apperception, but one of the very
conditions of dreaming. It enables us to carry on our
dreams; without it their progress would be fatally
inhibited by doubt, uncertainty, and struggle. So it
is, perhaps, that in all dreaming, or at all events in
certain stages of sleeping consciousness, we are liable
to fall into a state of pseudo-reminiscence.</p>

<p>It is an interesting and highly significant fact that
this paramnesic delusion of our dreams&mdash;the feeling
that the thing that is happening to us is the thing that
has happened to us before or that might happen to us
again&mdash;tends to persist in the hypnagogic (or hypnopompic)
stage immediately following sleep. When we
have half awakened from a dream and are just able to
realise that it was a dream, that dream constantly
tends to appear in a more plausible or probable light
than is possible a few moments later when we are fully
awake.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>The first experience which enabled me clearly to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
realise this phenomenon, and its probable explanation,
occurred many years ago. About the middle of the
night I had a very vivid dream, in which I imagined that
two friends&mdash;a gentleman and his daughter&mdash;with a
certain Lord Chesterfield (I had lately been reading
the <cite>Letters</cite> of the famous Lord Chesterfield), were
together at a hotel, that they were playing with
weapons, that the lady accidentally killed or wounded
Lord Chesterfield, and that she then changed clothes
with him with the object of escaping, and avoiding
discovery which would somehow be dangerous. I was
informed of the matter, and was much concerned. I
awoke, and my first thought was that I had just had a
curious dream which I must not forget in the morning.
But then I seemed to remember that it was a real and
familiar event. This second thought lulled my mental
activity, and I went to sleep again. In the morning I
was able to recall the main points in my dream, and
my thoughts on awaking from it.</p>

<p>Since then I have given attention to the point, and
I have found on recalling my half-waking consciousness
after dreams that, while it is doubtless rare to catch
the assertion 'That really occurred,' it is less rare to
catch the vague assertion, 'That is the kind of thing
that does occur.' I find that this latter impression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
appears, like the former, after vivid dreams which contain
no physical impossibility, but which the full
waking consciousness refuses to recognise as among
the things that are probable. As an example quite
unlike that just recorded, I may mention a dream in
which I imagined that I was proving the frequency
of local intermarriage by noting in directories the
frequency of the presence of people of the same name in
neighbouring towns and villages. On half-awaking
I still believed that I had actually been engaged in such
a task&mdash;that is, either that the dream was real or that
it referred to a real event&mdash;and it was not until I was
sufficiently awake to recognise the fallacy of such a
method of investigation that I realised that it was
purely a dream.</p>

<p>This phenomenon has long been known, although
its significance has not been perceived. Brierre de
Boismont pointed out that certain vivid dreams are
not recognised as dreams, but are mistaken for reality
after waking, though he scarcely recognised the normal
limitation of this mistake to the hypnagogic state.
Moll compared such dreams, thus continued into waking
life, to continuative post-hypnotic suggestions.
Sully mentioned awaking from dreams which 'still
wear the aspect of old acquaintances, so that for the
moment I think they are waking realities.'<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> Colegrove,
in his study of memory, recorded many cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
in which young people mistook their dreams for actual
events.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>This persistence of the memory illusion of sleep into
the subsequent hypnagogic state is obviously related
to the allied persistence, more occasionally found, of
the visual, auditory, and other sensory hallucinations
of sleep into the hypnagogic state.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> Visions thus seen
persisting from dreams for a few moments into waking
life are often very baffling and disturbing, as has already
been pointed out, to ignorant and untrained people.
Such visions may occur in the hypnagogic state, even
when there has been no conscious precedent dream,
and it is indeed probable, as Parish has argued, that it
is precisely in the hypnagogic state, the narthex of the
church of dreams, as I may term it, that hallucinations
are most liable to occur. That illusions may momentarily
occur in this state is obvious; thus falling asleep
for a few minutes when seated before a black hollow
smouldering fire, with red ashes at the bottom, I awake
with the illusion that I see a curtain on fire, and have
already leaned forward to snatch it away before I realise
my mistake.</p>

<p>Under normal conditions, the liability of a dream
memory to be mistaken for an actual event seems to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
greater when an interval has elapsed before the dream
is remembered, such an interval making it difficult
to distinguish one class of memories from the other,
provided the dream has been of a plausible character.
Thus Professor N&auml;cke has recorded that his wife dreamed
that an acquaintance, an old lady, had called at the
house; this dream was apparently forgotten until
forty or fifty hours afterwards when, on passing the old
lady's house, it was recalled, and the dreamer was only
with much difficulty convinced that the dream was not
an actual occurrence. When we are concerned with
memories of childhood, it not infrequently happens
that we cannot distinguish with absolute certainty
between real occurrences and what may possibly have
been dreams.</p>

<p>In normal physical and mental health, however, it
seems rare for the hallucinatory influence of dreams to
extend beyond the hypnagogic state, but any impairment
of the bodily health generally, and of the brain
in particular, may extend this confusion. Thus in a
case of heart disease terminating fatally, the patient,
though in health he was by no means visionary or
impressionable, became liable during sleep in the day-time
to dreams of an entirely reasonable character
which he had great difficulty in distinguishing from the
real facts of life, never feeling sure what had actually
happened, and what had been only a dream. In disordered
cerebral and nervous conditions the same
illusion becomes still more marked. This is notably
the case in hysteria. In some forms of insanity, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
many alienists have shown, this mistake is sometimes
permanent and the dream may become an integral
and persistent part of waking life. At this point,
however, we leave the normal world of dreams and
enter the sphere of pathology.</p>

<p>In the normal persistence of the dream illusion into
the hypnagogic state with which we are here concerned,
the dream usually presents a possible, though, it may be,
highly improbable event. The half-waking or hypnagogic
intelligence seems to be deceived by this element
of life-like possibility. Consequently a fallacy of perception
takes place strictly comparable to the fallacious
perception which, in the case of an external sensation,
we call an illusion. In the ordinary illusion an externally
excited sensation of one kind is mistaken for
an externally excited sensation of another kind. In
this case a centrally excited sensation of one order
(dream image) is mistaken for a centrally excited
sensation of another order (memory). The phenomenon
is, therefore, a mental illusion belonging to the group
of false memories, and it may be termed hypnagogic
paramnesia.</p>

<p>The process seems to have a certain interest, and it
may throw light on some rather obscure phenomena.
When we are able to recall a vivid dream, usually a
fairly probable dream, with no idea as to when it was
dreamed, and thus find ourselves in possession of
experiences of which we cannot certainly say that they
happened in waking life or in dream life, it seems
probable that this hypnagogic paramnesia has come into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
action; the half-waking consciousness dismisses the
vivid and life-like dream as an old and familiar experience,
shunting it off into temporary forgetfulness, unless
some accident again brings it into consciousness with,
as it were, a fragment of that wrong label still sticking
to it. Such a paramnesic process may thus also help
to account for the mighty part which, as so many
thinkers from Lucretius onwards have seen, dreams
have played in moulding human action and human
belief. It is a means whereby waking life and dream
life are brought to an apparently common level.</p>

<p>By hypnagogic paramnesia I mean a false memory
occurring in the ante-chamber of sleep, but not necessarily
before sleep. Myers's invention of the word
'hypnopompic' seems scarcely necessary even for
pedantic reasons. I take the condition of consciousness
to be almost the same whether the sleep is coming on
or passing away. In the Chesterfield dream it is indeed
impossible to say whether the phenomenon is
'hypnagogic' or 'hypnopompic'; in such a case the
twilight consciousness is as much conditioned by the
sleep that is passing away as by the sleep that is coming
on.</p>

<p>If this memory illusion of the half-waking state may
be regarded as a variety of paramnesia, a new horizon
is opened out to us. May not the hypnagogic variety
throw light on the general phenomenon of paramnesia
which has led to so many strange and complicated
theories? I think it may.</p>

<p>Paramnesia, as we have seen, is the psychologist's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
name for a hallucination of memory which is sometimes
called 'pseudo-reminiscence,' and by medical writers
(who especially associate it with epilepsy) regarded
as a symptom of 'dreamy state,'<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> while by French
authors it is often termed 'false recognition' or 'sensation
du d&eacute;j&agrave; vu.' Dickens, who seems himself to
have experienced it, thus describes it in <cite>David Copperfield:</cite>
'We have all some experience of a feeling that
comes over us occasionally, of what we are saying and
doing having been said or done before, in a remote
time, of having been surrounded, dim ages ago, by the
same faces, objects, and circumstances, of our knowing
perfectly what will be said next, as if we suddenly
remembered it.' Sometimes it seems that this previous
occurrence can only have taken place in a previous
existence,<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> whence we probably have, as St. Augustine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
seems first to have suggested, the origin of the idea
of metempsychosis, of the transmigration of souls;
sometimes it seems to have happened before in a
dream; sometimes the subject of the experience is
totally baffled in the attempt to account for the feeling
of familiarity which has overtaken him. In any case
he is liable to an emotion of distress which would
scarcely be caused by the coincidence of resemblance
with a real previous experience.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>Paramnesia of this kind is known, according to the
observations of Lalande,<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> to thirty people in a hundred,
and Heymans found it in a considerable proportion of
students of both sexes. Such estimates are probably
too high if we take into consideration the general
population. This experience seems, as Dugas and
others have noted,<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> to affect educated people, and
notably people of more than average intellect, who
use their brains much, especially in artistic and emotional
work, to a very much greater degree than the
ignorant and phlegmatic manual worker.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> Dickens
has already been mentioned; many other notable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
writers have referred to this or some allied feeling,
stating that they had experienced it, and Sir James
Crichton-Browne brings forward a number of passages
from the poets in evidence of their familiarity with
such phenomena.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> Shelley (who appears on at least
two occasions to have experienced hallucinations also)
underwent what may be regarded as an experience of
paramnesia (described in his <cite>Speculations on Metaphysics</cite>)
which is of interest in the present connection
because it brings this phenomenon into relation with
dreams. He was walking with a friend in the neighbourhood
of Oxford, when he suddenly turned the
corner of a country lane and saw 'a common scene' of
a windmill, etc., which, it immediately seemed to him,
he recollected having seen before in a dream of long
ago. Five years afterwards he was so agitated in writing
this down that he could not finish the account.
The real resemblance of 'a common scene' with a
similar dream scene, even supposing it could be recollected
when the two experiences were separated by a
long interval, would scarcely be a coincidence likely
to cause agitation. The emotion aroused seems to
mark the experience as belonging to the class of paramnesic
illusions which so often make a peculiarly vivid
impression on those to whom they occur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>A great many theories have been put forward by
psychologists and others to account for this paramnesic
phenomenon. The most ancient explanation,
long anterior to the beginnings of scientific psychology,
was the theory that the occurrence which, as it now
happens, strikes us as so overwhelmingly familiar
had actually occurred to us in a previous existence
long ages before; thus Pythagoras, according to the
ancient story, when he visited the temple of Juno at
Argos recognised the shield he had worn ages before
when he was Euphorbus and fought with Menelaus
in the Trojan war. A much more recent theory runs
to the opposite extreme and claims that all or nearly
all these cases of recognition indicate a real but confused
reminiscence of past events in our present life,
dim recollections which the subject is unable definitely
to locate. This is the explanation largely relied on by
Ribot, Jessen, Sander, Sully, Burnham, and many
others. It was perhaps largely due to ignorance of
the phenomenon; Ribot, when he wrote his book on
the diseases of memory, considered that only three or
four cases had been recorded, for an abnormal phenomenon
always seems rare until it is recognised and
definitely searched for. Undoubtedly, this theory will
explain a considerable proportion of cases, but not
really typical cases in which the subject has an
overwhelming conviction that even the minute details
of the present experience have been experienced before.
We may read a new poem with a vague sense of familiarity,
but such an experience never puts on a really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
paramnesic character, for we quickly realise that it is
explainable by the fact that the writer of the poem has
fallen under the influence of some greater master. The
only experience I can personally speak of as at all
approaching true paramnesia occurred on visiting
the ruins of Pevensey Castle many years ago. On
going up the slope towards the ivy-covered ruins,
bathed in bright sunlight, I experienced a strange and
abiding sense of familiarity with the scene. Three
theories might account for this experience (for I refrain
from including the Pythagorean theory that I experienced
a reminiscence of the experience of a possible
ancestor coming from across the Thames to the assistance
of Harold against William the Conqueror at this
spot): (1) that it was a case of true paramnesia; (2)
that I had been taken to the spot as a child; (3) that
the view was included among a series of coloured stereoscopic
pictures with which I was familiar as a child, and
which certainly contained similar scenes. I incline
to this last explanation. Here, as elsewhere, there are
no keys which will unlock all doors.</p>

<p>A modification of the theory that the pseudo-reminiscence
is an unrecognised real reminiscence
is furnished by Grasset, who considers that the phenomenon
is due to a subconscious impression previously
received, but only reaching consciousness under the
influence of the new similar impression. This theory
would include the revival of dream images, and is therefore
related to the theory of Lapie and M&eacute;r&eacute;, according
to which the feeling of many of these subjects that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
what they now experience had happened before in a
dream is the correct explanation of the phenomenon.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>We enter on a different class of explanations with
the early theory of Wigan that such cases are due to
the duality of the brain, the two hemispheres not acting
quite simultaneously. This is a somewhat crude conception,
though it may seem approximately on the lines
of more recent theories. The theory of the duplex
brain, each hemisphere being supposed capable of
acting independently, was at one time invoked to explain
many phenomena, but it is no longer regarded as
tenable.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p>We may dismiss these theories, which have been
effectively criticised by others, and revert to our clue in
the sleeping and hypnagogic state. The hypnagogic
state is a transition between waking and sleeping. It
is thus a condition of mental feebleness and suggestibility
doubtless correlated with a condition of irregular
brain anaemia. A plausible suggestion under such
conditions is too readily accepted. Does ordinary
paramnesia occur under similar conditions of mental
feebleness and suggestibility? It is rare to find descriptions
of paramnesic experiences by scientific
observers who are alive to the importance of accurately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
recording all the conditions, but there is some reason
to think that paramnesia does occur in states produced
by excitement, exhaustion, and allied causes.
The earliest case of paramnesia recorded in detail by a
trained observer is that described by Wigan as occurring
to himself at the funeral of the Princess Charlotte.
He had passed several disturbed nights previous to the
ceremony, with almost complete deprivation of rest
on the night immediately preceding; he was suffering
from grief as well as from exhaustion from want of
food; he had been standing for four hours, and would
have fainted on taking his place by the coffin if it had
not been for the excitement of the occasion. When the
music ceased the coffin slowly sank in absolute silence,
broken by an outburst of grief from the bereaved
husband. 'In an instant,' Wigan proceeds, 'I felt
not merely an <em>impression</em>, but a <em>conviction</em>, that I had
seen the whole scene before on some former occasion.'
Such a condition may fairly be regarded as an artificial
reproduction, by means of emotion, excitement, and
exhaustion, of the condition which occurs simply and
naturally in sleep or on its hypnagogic borderland.</p>

<p>The frequency&mdash;if it may be taken to be a fact&mdash;of
the occurrence of pseudo-reminiscence in epileptics,
noted by various medical observers, whether at the
onset of the fit or independently of any obvious muscular
convulsion, may be significant in this connection.
There is no good reason to suppose that pseudo-reminiscence
has a true relation to epilepsy, and still less
that it necessarily constitutes a minor epileptic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
paroxysm. But the special sleep-like condition of
contracted cerebral circulation in epilepsy renders it
favourable to paramnesia as well as to hallucinatory
phenomena.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p>Independently of epilepsy, any condition of temporary
and perhaps chronic nervous exhaustion may produce,
or at all events predispose to, the paramnesic delusion
of recognising present experiences as familiar. Thus
Rosenbach has recorded the case of a sane and healthy
man, who, after severe mental labour, followed by
sleeplessness, seemed to know all the people he met in
the street, though on close examination he found he
was mistaken.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> Such a condition may even be almost
congenital. Thus of Anna Kingsford, who was of highly
strung and neurotic disposition, we are told that, as a
child, 'all that she read struck her as already familiar
to her, so that she seemed to herself to be recovering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
old recollections rather than acquiring fresh knowledge.'<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>It is noteworthy that artificial anaesthesia by drugs
which produce an abnormal sleep also favours paramnesia.
Thus Sir William Ramsay<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> has stated that
when, under an anaesthetic, he heard a slight noise in
the street, 'I not merely knew that it had happened
before, but I could have predicted that it would happen
at that very moment.'</p>

<p>In all these conditions we appear to be in the presence
of an enfeebled, excited, and impaired state of consciousness
approximating to the true confusion of dream
consciousness. It seems as if externally aroused sensations
in such cases are received by the exhausted
cerebral centres in so blurred a form that an illusion
takes place, and they are mistaken for internally
excited sensations, for memories.</p>

<p>That paramnesia is a fatigue product&mdash;even though
often a product of nervous hyperaesthesia&mdash;is indicated
by the statements of many who have described it.
Anjel long ago emphasised this fatigue, and Bonatelli,
also at an early period, found that illusions of memory
were specially liable to occur in states of unusual
nervous irritability. During recent years this characteristic
of paramnesia has been more and more
frequently recognised. Bernard Leroy, who devoted a
lengthy and important Paris thesis to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
pseudo-reminiscence,<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> showed that a certain proportion of cases
indicated the presence of fatigue or distraction.
Heymans found that it was in the evening, when his
subjects were in a passive condition, tired, exhausted,
or engaged in uncongenial work, that they were most
liable to the experience.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> F&eacute;r&eacute; brought forward a
case in which, as he pointed out, pseudo-reminiscence
in a healthy man, convalescent from influenza, was
associated with fatigue and disappeared with it.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>
Dromard and Alb&egrave;s declare that pseudo-reminiscence
is 'a phenomenon of exhaustion,' and one of them makes
the significant statement: 'I become more easily the
prey of this illusion when, by chance and without
thinking of it, I simultaneously apply my attention
to an external object and an internal thought.'<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> Dugas,
again, considers that all the various forms of paramnesia
have 'one common character, which is that they occur
as the result of prolonged or intense fatigue';<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> he
adds that most of the cases of paramnesia he has noted
in young people during fifteen years coincided with
periods of anaemia and nervous weakness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not, however, necessary to believe that fatigue,
in the ordinary sense of the word, whether physical or
mental, is the invariable accompaniment of paramnesia.
If it is the presence of a condition resembling that of
sleep or the hypnagogic state which predisposes to
the experience, that condition may be produced by
other circumstances. Distraction, excited hyperaesthesia
simulating increased power, and various chronic psychic
states <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'hue'">due</ins> to a highly-strung or over-strained nervous
system may all tend in the same direction, even though
no sense of exhaustion is felt.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> This is doubtless why
it is that so many poets, novelists, and other men
of strenuous intellectual aptitude are liable to this
experience.</p>

<p>It has been argued by some who admit that there is
often an element of fatigue in paramnesia,<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> that the
real cause of the false memory is an abnormal celerity
of perception, perhaps due to hyperaesthesia. The
scene would thus be perceived so quickly that the subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
concludes that he must have had this experience before.
That the subject often has a feeling of unusual rapidity
of perception may very well be admitted. But there
is no reason whatever to suppose that the perception
actually is received with any such unusual rapidity.
The probabilities are in the other direction. We know
that many influences (such as drugs like alcohol) which
produce a feeling of heightened and quickened perceptions
really have a slowing and dulling effect, in
the same way as the wise and beautiful things we utter
in dreams are usually found on awaking to be commonplace,
if not meaningless. There is no evidence to show
that paramnesia is accompanied by a real heightening
of perception, while, as we have seen, a broad survey
of the facts makes it more reasonable to suppose that
we have, on the contrary, a sudden fall towards the
dream state, a state in which, as Tissi&eacute; and others have
pointed out, there are many stages.</p>

<p>It must be remembered in this connection that in the
hypnagogic and other states related to sleep we are not
able to estimate time conditions consciously, though,
as the frequent ability to wake at fixed moments indicates,
we may do so subconsciously. Time is long,
short, or non-existent in dream-like states. This is
always true of the onset of the hypnagogic state. When
I am suddenly awakened at night by a voice or a bell
or other stimulus, I often find it very difficult to say
whether I was or was not already awake, and have
frequently replied, when so awakened, that I was already
awake. That is an illusion, as is shown by the frequency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
with which elderly people who fall asleep in the day
time, will declare, though they may have been snoring
a moment before, that they have never been asleep.
By a somewhat similar paramnesic illusion we can
never fix the exact moment when we awake. When
we become conscious that we are awake it always
seems to us that we are already awake, awake for an
indefinite time, and not that we have just awakened.
If I had to register the exact moment I awake in the
morning I should usually feel that I was considerably
late in making the observation. It seems that the imperfect
hypnagogic consciousness projects itself behind.
At the first onset, consciousness is not sufficiently
developed to be able to realise that it is beginning, and
when it becomes sufficiently developed to make such a
statement the moment when it can be correctly made is
already past. Consciousness is only able to assert
that it has been continuing for an indefinite time.
And that assertion involves a paramnesic illusion of
putting back a present experience into the past, analogous
to the illusion of pseudo-reminiscence.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>If we realise these characteristics of paramnesia
we can scarcely fail to conclude that we are concerned
here with illusions which, while they fall within the
sphere of memory, are largely conditioned by the whole
psychic condition. As in dreams, it is inattention,
failure of apperception, defective association of the
mental contents, which make the paramnesia possible.
Paramnesia is, as Fouill&eacute;e has said, a kind of diplopia
or seeing double in the mental field. 'I have the
impression,' says one of the writers on this subject who
himself experiences the sensation, 'that the present
reality has a <em>double</em>.' Actual double vision is due to
the failure of that muscular co-ordination which, as
Ribot and others have insisted, is of the very essence of
attention. This wider psychic basis on which paramnesia
rests has of late been recognised by several psychologists.
Thus L&eacute;on-Kindberg states that in paramnesia
there is an absence of mental attention, of the
effort of synthesis necessary to grasp an actual occurrence,
which is, therefore, perceived with the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
facility as a memory not requiring synthesis, with the
resulting illusion that it is a memory.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> Ballet, again,
regards paramnesia as a transitory or permanent
psychasthenic state, due to dissociation.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> Dugas, also,
who has repeatedly returned to this subject during
many years, in his latest contributions attaches
primary importance to this broader factor of paramnesia.
In analysing memory, he says, there is an
element which, though often overlooked, is capital:
the recognition of a state of consciousness not merely
as passed, but as bound up with our own personal
past; when that synthetic function ceases to be accomplished,
or is only accomplished defectively, then
memory is lacking or perverted. Nervous weakness,
he proceeds, produces failure of attention, the inhibitory
power of attention being no longer exerted, and the
psychic elements fall back to anarchy. Now many
psychic states, such as sensations, recollections, and
images, differ from each other less by their substance
than by the way in which the mind takes hold of and
apprehends them. The mind seizes a sensation with a
stronger grasp than a recollection, and a recollection
with a stronger grasp than an image. When attention
is relaxed the line of demarcation between these psychic
states tends to be effaced; the sensation becomes
vague and floating like the recollection and the image,
while the recollection and the image, on the contrary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
become objective and acquire something of the brilliance
and relief of the sensation. The very same cause&mdash;enfeeblement
of attention&mdash;thus produces opposite
effects, on the one side raising the tone, on the other
lowering it, so that states of mind which are ordinarily
distinct tend to be approximated and confused, as we
may observe in the hypnagogic condition.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>Although Dugas makes no reference to Janet, it
is not difficult to see that he has assimilated some of
the views of that distinguished investigator of psychic
mysteries. Janet, as we know, in various morbid
psychic conditions, attaches great explanatory force
to the individual's loss of hold, through psychic weakness,
of his own personality, and to the diminished
sense of reality and even depersonalisation thence
ensuing. It so happens that Janet himself has set
forth a theory of pseudo-reminiscence which is characteristic
of his own attitude, and also harmonises with
the wider outlook which now marks the attempts to
explain these perversions of memory. Janet declares
that pseudo-reminiscence is a negative phenomenon
and belongs to a group in which various other feelings
of diminished sense of reality belong. These people all
say in effect: 'It seems to me that these things are not
real; it seems to me that these events are not actual
or present.' The essence of this form of paramnesia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
is thus more a negation of the present than an affirmation
of the past. 'The function of adaptation to the
present moment,' Janet remarks, 'is the most complicated
and the most recent of all. The function of the
real is the most elevated and the most difficult of all
cerebral functions.' Under various influences there is
a diminution of nervous and psychic tension, and such
suppression of the high tension of the mind leaves
only the lower functions subsisting. When that fall
of tension is rapid, there may be a crisis of which pseudo-reminiscence
is one of the symptoms.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> Janet would
thus place pseudo-reminiscence among the manifestations
of psychasthenia, though he leaves untouched
the difficult question of its precise mechanism.</p>

<p>The most comprehensive attempt to explain the
mystery of paramnesia in recent years is certainly that
made in an elaborately eclectic study by one of the most
distinguished of living French thinkers, Professor
Bergson.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> He first casts a glance over what he considers
the two main groups of explanations of this
puzzling phenomenon: (1) those, advocated by Ribot,
Fouill&eacute;e, Lalande, Arnaud, Pi&eacute;ron, Myers, etc., which
involve the more or less simultaneous existence in
consciousness of two images, of which one is the reproduction
of the other; (2) those advocated by
Janet, Heymans, L&eacute;on-Kindberg, Dromard and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
Alb&egrave;s, etc., which insist on the lower mental tone,
the diminished attention, the lack of synthetising
power, which mark the condition in which paramnesia
occurs. Bergson is quite ready to accept the principles
of both these groups of explanations, and to combine
them. But, he argues, to understand the phenomenon
adequately, we must go deeper; we must analyse the
normal mechanism of memory. And he finds, if we do
this, that not merely the moment of a paramnesic
illusion, but every moment of our life, offers two aspects,
actual and virtual, perception on one side, and memory
on the other. The moment itself, indeed, consists
of such a scission, for it is always moving, always a
fleeting boundary between the immediate past and the
immediate future, and would be a mere abstraction
if it were not 'precisely the mobile mirror which ceaselessly
reflects perception in recollection.' When the
matter is thus regarded a recollection is seen to be, in
reality, not something which has been, but something
which is, proceeding <em xml:lang="la" lang="la">pari passu</em> with the perception it
reproduces. It is a recollection of the moment taking
place at that moment. Belonging to the past as regards
its form, it belongs to the present as regards its
matter. It is recollection of the present. Now this is
exactly the state in which the paramnesic person
consciously finds himself, and the only problem before
us, therefore, is to ascertain why every one at every
moment is not conscious of the same experience.
Bergson replies that nothing is more useless for present
action than the recollection of the present. It has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
nothing to tell us; we hold the real object, and to
give up that for its recollection would be to sacrifice
the substance to the shadow. Therefore we obstinately
and persistently turn away from the recollection of the
present. It emerges consciously only under the influence
of some abnormal or pathological disturbance
of attention. Paramnesia is an anomaly of this kind,
and it is due to a temporary enfeeblement of the general
attention to life, a momentary arrest of the forward
movement of consciousness. 'False recognition,' Bergson
concludes, 'may thus be regarded as the most
inoffensive form of inattention to life. It seems to
result from the combined play of perception and memory
given up to their own energy. It would take place at
every moment if it were not that will, ceaselessly
directed towards action, prevents the present from
folding in on itself by pushing it indefinitely into the
future.'</p>

<p>So far as my own explanation is concerned, it will
be seen that I still place weight on the general condition
of temporary or chronic nervous fatigue as the soil
on which paramnesia arises&mdash;a belief now accepted
by most psychologists<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>&mdash;and that I think we must
search for the clue to the mechanism of the illusion in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
those dreaming and hypnagogic states in which it most
often occurs. As regards a definite explanation of the
mechanism we must, in the face of so many ingenious
and complicated theories, perhaps still await more
general agreement.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> What I have suggested, and
am still inclined to maintain, is that the psychic enfeeblement,
temporary or chronic, which is the general
preliminary condition of paramnesia, whether or not
there is any subjective sensation of increased power,
may account for the paramnesia by bringing an externally
aroused perception down to a lower and fainter
stage on which it is on a level with an internally aroused
perception&mdash;a memory. Just as in hypnagogic paramnesia
the vivid and life-like dream, or internal impression,
is raised to the class of memories, and becomes the
shadow of a real experience, so in waking paramnesia
the external impression is lowered to the same class.
Perception is alike dulled in each case, and the immediate
experience follows the line of least resistance&mdash;this
time too carelessly or too prematurely&mdash;to join
the great bulk of our experiences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>We thus realise how it is that that doubling of experience
occurs. The mind has for the moment become
flaccid and enfeebled; its loosened texture has, as it
were, abnormally enlarged the meshes in which sensations
are caught and sifted, so that they run through
too easily. In other words, they are not properly
<em>apperceived</em>. To use a crude simile, it is as though we
poured water into a sieve. The impressions of the
world which are actual sensations as they strike the
relaxed psychic meshwork are instantaneously passed
through to become memories, and we see them in both
forms at the same moment, and are unable to distinguish
one from the other.</p>

<p>In sleep, and in the hypnagogic state, as in hypnosis,
we accept a suggestion, with or without a struggle.
In the waking paramnesic state we seem to find, in a
slighter stage of a like condition, <em>the same process in a
reversed form</em>. Instead of accepting a representation
as an actual present fact, we accept the actual present
fact as merely a representation. The centres of perception
are in such a state of exhaustion and disorder
that they receive an actual external sensation in the
feebler shape of a representation. The actual fact
becomes merely a suggestion of far distant things. It
reaches consciousness in the enfeebled shape of an old
memory&mdash;</p>

<p>Paramnesia is thus an internal hallucination, a reversed
hallucination, it is true, but while so reversed, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
stream of consciousness is still following the line of least
resistance.</p>

<p>It is along some such lines as these, it seems to me,
that we may best attempt to explain the phenomena
of paramnesia, phenomena which are of no little
interest since, in earlier stages of culture, they may well
have had a real influence on belief, suggesting to
primitive man that he had somehow had wider experiences
than he knew of, and that, as Wordsworth put it,
he trailed clouds of glory behind him.</p>

<p class="p6">CONCLUSION</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Fundamental Nature of Dreaming&mdash;Insanity and Dreaming&mdash;The
Child's Psychic State and the Dream State&mdash;Primitive
Thought and Dreams&mdash;Dreaming and Myth-Making&mdash;Genius
and Dreams&mdash;Dreaming as a Road into the Infinite.</p></blockquote>


<p>In the preceding chapters we have traced some of the
elementary tendencies which prevail in the formation
of dreams. These tendencies are in some respects so
unlike those that rule in waking life&mdash;slight and subtle
as their unlikeness often seems&mdash;that we are justified
in regarding the psychic phenomena of sleeping life as
constituting a world of their own.</p>

<p>Yet when we look at the phenomena a little more
deeply we realise that, however differentiated they have
become, dream life is yet strictly co-ordinated with
other forms of psychic life. If we pierce below the
surface we seem to reach a primitive fundamental
psychic stage in which the dreamer, the madman, the
child, and the savage alike have their starting point,
and possess a degree of community from which the
waking, civilised, sane adult of to-day is shut out, so
that he can only comprehend it by an intellectual
effort.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> It thus happens that the ways of thinking and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
feeling of the child and the savage and the lunatic each
furnish a road by which we may reach a psychic world
which is essentially that of the dreamer.</p>

<p>The resemblance of insanity to dream life has, above
all, impressed observers from the time when the nature
of insanity was first definitely recognised. It would be
outside the limits of the present book to discuss the
points at which dreams resemble or differ from insanity,
but it is worth while to touch on the question of their
affinity. The recognition of this affinity, or at all
events analogy, though it was stated by Cabanis to be
due to Cullen, is as old as Aristotle, and has constantly
been put forward afresh. Thus in the sixteenth century
Du Laurens (A. Laurentius), in his treatise on the
disease of melancholy, as insanity was then termed,
compared it to dreaming.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> The same point is still
constantly brought forward by the more philosophic
physician. 'Find out all about dreams,' Hughlings
Jackson has said, 'and you will have found out all
about insanity.' From the wider standpoint of the
psychologist, Jastrow points out that not only insanity,
but all the forms of delirium, including the drug-intoxications,
are 'variants of dream consciousness.'</p>

<p>The reality of the affinity of dreaming and insanity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
is well illustrated by a case, coming under the observation
of Marro, in which a dream, formed according
to the ordinary rules of dreaming, produced a temporary
fit of insanity in an otherwise perfectly sane subject.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>
In this case a highly intelligent but somewhat neurotic
young man was returning to Italy after pursuing his
studies abroad, and reached Turin, on the homeward
journey, in a somewhat tired state. In the train he
believed that he had detected some cardsharpers, and
that they suspected him of finding them out, and bore
him ill-will in consequence. This produced a state of
general nervous apprehension. At the hotel his room
was over the kitchen; it was in consequence very hot,
and to a late hour he could still hear voices and catch
snatches of conversation, which seemed to him to be
directed against himself. His suspicions deepened, he
heard noises, in reality due to the kitchen utensils,
which seemed preparations for his murder, and he
ultimately became convinced that there was a plot
to set fire to his room in order to force him to leave it,
when he would be seized and murdered. He resolved
to escape, got out of the window with his revolver in
his hand, found his way to another part of the house,
encountered a man who had been awakened by his
movements, and shot at him, believing him to be a
party to the imaginary conspiracy. He was seized
and taken to the asylum, where he speedily regained
calm, and realised the delusion into which he had fallen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
When questioned by Marro, on reaching the asylum,
he was unaware that he had ever fallen asleep during
the night; he could not, however, account for all the
time that had elapsed before he left the room, and it
was probable, Marro concludes, that he was in a state
between waking and sleeping, and that his delusion was
constituted in a dream. Fatigue, nervous apprehension,
an unduly hot bedroom, the close proximity of servants'
voices, and the sound of kitchen utensils, had thus
combined, in a state of partial sleep, to produce in an
otherwise sane person, a morbid condition in every
respect identical with that found in insane persons who
are suffering from systematised delusions of persecution.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>The resemblance of the child's psychic state to the
dream state is an observation of less ancient date than
that of the analogy between dreaming and insanity,
but it has frequently been made by modern psychologists.
'In dreams,' says Freud, 'the child with his impulses
lives again,'<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> and Giessler has devoted a chapter to
the points of resemblance between dream life and the
mental activity of children.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p>I should be more especially inclined to find the dream-like
character of the child's mind at three points:
(1) the abnormally logical tendency of the child's mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
and the daring mental fusions which he effects in forming
theories; (2) the greater preponderance of hypnagogic
phenomena and hallucinations in childhood, as
well as the large element of reverie or day-dreaming
in the child's life, and the facility with which he confuses
this waking imagination with reality; and (3) the
child's tendency to mistake, also, the dreams of the
night for real events.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> This last tendency is of serious
practical import when it leads a child, in all innocence,
to make criminal charges against other persons.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> This
tendency clearly indicates the close resemblance which
there is for children between dream life and waking
life; it also shows the great vividness which children's
dreams possess. In imaginative children, it may be
added, a rich and vivid dream life is not infrequently
the direct source of literary activities which lead to
distinction in later life.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>The child, we are often told, is the representative of
the modern savage and the primitive man. That is
not, in any strict sense, true, nor can we assume without
question that early man and modern savages are
identical. But we can have very little doubt that in
our dreams we are brought near to ways of thought and
feeling that are sometimes closer to those of early man, as
well as of latter-day savages, than are our psychic modes
in civilisation.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> So remote are we to-day from the world
of our dreams that we very rarely draw from them the
inspiration of our waking lives. For the primitive man
the laws of the waking world are not yet widely differentiated
from the laws of the sleeping world, and he
finds it not unreasonable to seek illumination for the
problems of one world in the phenomena of the other.
The doctrine of animism, as first formulated by Tylor
(more especially in his <cite>Primitive Culture</cite>) finds in
dreams the chief source of primitive religion and
philosophy. Of recent years there has been a tendency
to reject the theory of animism.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> Certainly it is
possible to rely too exclusively on dreams as the inspiration
of early man; if the evidence of dreams had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
not been in a line with the evidence that he derived
from other sources, there is no reason why the man of
primitive times should have attached any peculiar
value to dreams. But if the animistic conception
presents too extreme a view of the primitive importance
of dreaming, we must beware lest the reaction against
it should lead us to fall into the opposite extreme.
Durkheim argues that it is unlikely that early man
attaches much significance to dreams, for the modern
peasant, who is the representative of primitive man,
appears to dream very little, and not to attach much
importance to his dreams. But it is by no means
true that the peasant of civilisation, with his fixed
agricultural life, corresponds to early man who was
mainly a hunter and often a nomad. Under the conditions
of civilisation the peasant is fed regularly and
leads a peaceful, stolid, laborious, and equable life,
which is altogether unfavourable to psychic activity
of any kind, awake or asleep. The savage man, now
and ever, as a hunter and fighter, leads a life of comparative
idleness, broken by spurts of violent activity;
sometimes he can gorge himself with food, sometimes
he is on the verge of starvation. He lives under conditions
that are more favourable to the psychic side of
life, awake or asleep, than is the case with the peasant
of civilisation.</p>

<p>Moreover, it must be remembered that all the peoples
whom we may fairly regard as in some degree resembling
early man possess a specialised caste of exceptional
men who artificially cultivate their psychic activities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
and thereby exert great influence on their fellows.
These are termed, after their very typical representatives
in some Siberian tribes, <em>shamans</em>, and combine the
functions of priests and sorcerers and medicine men.
It is nearly everywhere found that the shaman&mdash;who
is often, it would appear, at the outset a somewhat
abnormal person&mdash;cultivates solitude, fasting, and all
manner of ascetic practices, thereby acquiring an
unusual aptitude to dream, to see visions, to experience
hallucinations, and, it may well be, to acquire abnormally
clairvoyant powers. The shamans of the Andamanese
are called by a word signifying dreamer, and in
various parts of the world the shaman finds the first
sign of his vocation in a dream. The evocation of
dreams is often the chief end of the shaman's abnormal
method of life. Thus, among the Salish Indians of
British Columbia, dreams are the proper mode of
communication with guardian spirits, and 'prolonged
fasts, bathings, forced vomitings, and other exhausting
bodily exercises are the means adopted for inducing
the mystic dreams and visions.'<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>When we witness the phenomena of Shamanism in all
parts of the world it is difficult to dispute the statement
of Lucretius that the gods first appeared to men in
dreams. This may be said to be literally true; even
to-day it often happens that the savage's totem, who is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
practically his tutelary deity, first appears to him in a
dream.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> An influence which seems likely to have been
so persistent may well have had a large plastic power
in moulding the myths and legends which everywhere
embody the religious impulses of men. This idea was
long ago suggested by Hobbes. 'From this ignorance
of how to distinguish dreams and other strong Fancies,'
he wrote, 'from Vision and Sense, did arise the greatest
part of the Religion of the Gentiles in time past, that
worshipped Satyrs, Fauns, Nymphs, and the like.'<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>Ludwig Laistner, however, appears to have been the
first to argue in detail that dreams, and especially
nightmares, have played an important part in the
evolution of mythological ideas. 'If we bear in mind,'
he said in the Preface to his great work, 'how intimately
poetry and religion are connected with myth, we
encounter the surprising fact that the first germ of these
highly important vital manifestations is not to be found
in any action of the waking mind, but in sleep, and that
the chief and oldest teacher of productive imagination
is not to be found in the experiences of life, but in the
phantasies of dream.'<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> The pictures men formed of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
the over-world and the under-world have the character
of dreams and hypnagogic visions, and this is true even
within the sphere of Christianity.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> The invention of
Hell, Maudsley has declared, would find an adequate
explanation, if such is needed, in the sufferings of some
delirious patients, while the apocalyptic vision of Heaven
with which our Christian Bible concludes, is, Beaunis
remarks, nothing but a long dream.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> And if it is true,
as Baudelaire has said, that 'every well conformed
brain carries within it two infinites: Heaven and Hell,'
we may well believe that both Heaven and Hell find their
most vivid symbolism in the spontaneous action of
dreams.</p>

<p>In migraine and the epileptic aura visions of diminutive
creatures sometimes occur, and occasionally micropsic
vision in which real objects appear diminished.
It has been suggested by Sir Lauder Brunton that we
may here have the origin of fairies, at all events for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
some races of fairies; for fairies, though diminutive
in some countries, as in England, are not diminutive
in others, as in Ireland. A more normal and frequent
channel of intercourse with such creatures is, however,
to be found in dreams. This is illustrated by the
following dream experienced by a lady: 'I saw a man
wheeling along a cripple. Eventually the cripple
became reduced to about the size of a walnut, and the
man told me that he had the power of becoming any
size and of going anywhere. To my horror he then
threw him into the water. In answer to my remonstrances
that he would surely be drowned, the man said
that it was all right, the little fellow would be home
in a few hours. He then shouted out, "What time do
you expect to get back?" The tiny creature, who
was paddling along in the water, then took out a
miniature watch, and replied: "About seven!"'<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>
In a dream of my own I saw little creatures, a few inches
high, moving about and acting on a diminutive stage.
Though I regarded them as really living creatures, and
not marionettes, the spectacle caused me no surprise.</p>

<p>The dream-like character of myths, legends, and
fairy tales is probably, however, not entirely due to
direct borrowing from the actual dreams of sleep, or
even from the hallucinations connected with insanity,
music, or drugs, though all these may have played
their part. The greater nearness of the primitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
mind to the dream-state involves more than a tendency
to embody in waking life conceptions obtained from
dreams. It means that the waking psychic life itself
is capable of acting in a way resembling that of the
sleeping psychic life, and of evolving conceptions
similar to dreams.</p>

<p>This point of view has in recent years been especially
set forth by Freud and his school, who argue that the
laws of the formation of myths and fairy tales are
identical with the laws in accordance with which
dreams are formed.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> It certainly seems to be true that
the resemblances between dreams and legends are not
adequately explained by supposing that the latter are
moulded out of the former. We have to believe that
on the myth-making plane of thought we are really
on a plane that is more nearly parallel with that
of dreaming than is our ordinary civilised thought.
We are in a world of things that are supernormally
enormous or delicate, and the emotional vibrations
vastly enlarged, a world in which miracles happen
on every hand and cause us no surprise. Slaughter
and destruction take place on the heroic scale with a
minimum expenditure of effort; men are transformed
into beasts and beasts into men, so that men and beasts
converse with each other.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally, it may be observed that the atmosphere
into which genius leads us, and indeed all art, is the
atmosphere of the world of dreams. The man of genius,
it is often said, has the child within him; he is, according
to the ancient dictum, which is still accepted, not
without an admixture of insanity, and he is unquestionably
related to the primitive myth-maker. All these
characteristics, as we see, bring him near to the sphere
of dreaming, and we may say that the man of genius
is in closer touch with the laws of the dream world
than is the ordinary civilised man. 'It would be no
great paradox,' remarks Maudsley, 'to say that the
creative work of genius was excellent dreaming, and
dramatic dreaming distracted genius.'<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> This has often
been recognised by some of the most typical men of
genius. Charles Lamb, in speaking of Spenser, referred
to the analogy between dreaming and imagination.
Coleridge, one of the most essential of imaginative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
men, argued that the laws of drama and of dreaming
are the same.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> Nietzsche, more recently, has developed
the affinity of dreaming to art, and in his <cite>Birth
of Tragedy</cite> argued that the Appollonian or dream-like
element is one of the two constituents of tragedy.
Mallarm&eacute; further believed that symbolism, which we
have seen to be fundamental in dreaming, is of the
essence of art. 'To name an object,' he said, 'is
to suppress three-quarters of the enjoyment in a
poem which is made up of the happiness of gradually
divining; to suggest&mdash;that is our dream. The perfect
usage of this mystery constitutes symbolism: to evoke
an object, little by little, in order to exhibit a state of
the soul, or, inversely, to choose an object, and to disengage
from it a state of the soul by a series of decipherments.'<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>
It may be added that imaginative and artistic
men have always been prone to day-dreaming and
reverie, allowing their fancies to wander uncontrolled,
and in so doing they have found profit to their work.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>
From Socrates onwards, too, men of genius have sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
been liable to fall into states of trance, or waking
dream, in which their mission or their vision has become
more clearly manifested;<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> the hallucinatory voices
which have determined the vocation of many great
teachers belong to psychic states allied to these trances.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to refer to the occasional
creative activity of men of genius during actual sleep
or to the debts which they have acknowledged to
suggestions received in dreams.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> This has perhaps,
indeed, been more often exaggerated than overlooked.
There can be no doubt that a great many writers and
thinkers, including some of the highest eminence, have
sometimes been indebted to their dreams. We might
expect as much, for most people occasionally have
more or less vivid or suggestive new ideas in dreams,<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>
and it is natural that this should occur more often, and
to a higher degree, in persons of unusual intellectual
force and activity. But it is more doubtful whether
the creative activity of normal dreams ever reaches a
sufficient perfection to take, as it stands, a very high
place in a master's work. Coleridge's 'Kubla Khan'
has the most notable claim to be an exception to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
rule. This poem was written by Coleridge in 1788,
soon after 'Christabel,' and at a time when the poet
was suffering much from depression, and taking a great
deal of laudanum. We are entitled to assume, therefore,
that the poem was composed under the influence
of opium, and not in normal sleep. It may be added
that it is difficult to believe that Coleridge could have
recalled the whole poem from either a normal or abnormal
dream; as a rule, when we compose verses in
sleep we can usually recall only the last two, or at most
four, lines.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> Moreover, there is reason to believe that
the first draft of 'Kubla Khan' was not the poem as
we now know it.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<p>After Coleridge's 'Kubla Khan' the most important
artistic composition usually assigned to a dream is the
<em>Trillo del Diavolo</em> sonata of Tartini, the eighteenth-century
composer and violinist, who has been called
the prototype of Paganini. Tartini, who was a man of
nervous and emotional temperament, seems to have
possessed real genius, and this sonata is his principal
work. But there is not the slightest ground for stating
that it was composed in a dream, and Tartini himself
made no such claim.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>The imaginative reality of dreams is perhaps appreciated
by none so much as by those who are deprived
of some of their external senses. Thus a deaf and dumb
writer of ability who has precise and highly emotional
dreams&mdash;which sometimes remind him of the atmosphere
of Poe's tales, and are occasionally in organised
sequence from night to night&mdash;writes: 'The enormous
reality and vividness of these dreams is their remarkable
point. They leave a mark behind. When I
come to consider I believe that much that I have written,
and many things that I have said and thought and
believed, are directly due to these dream-experiences
and my ponderings over how they came. Beneath the
superficiality of our conscious mind&mdash;prim, smug, self-satisfied,
owlishly wise&mdash;there lies the vast gulf of a
subconscious personality that is dark and obscure,
seldom seen or even suspected. It is this, I think, that
wells up into my dreams. It is always there&mdash;always
affecting us and modifying us, and bringing about
strange and unforeseen new things in us&mdash;but in these
dreams I peer over the edge of the conscious world
into the giant-house and Utgard of the subconscious,
lit by one ray of sunset that shows the weltering deeps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
of it. And the vivid sense of this is responsible for
many things in my life.'<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p>Dreaming is thus one of our roads into the infinite.
And it is interesting to observe how we attain it&mdash;by
limitation. The circle of our conscious life is narrowed
during sleep; it is even by a process of psychic
dissociation broken up into fragments. From that
narrowed and broken-up consciousness the outlook
becomes vaster and more mysterious, full of strange
and unsuspected fascination, and the possibilities of
new experiences, just as a philosophic mite inhabiting
a universe consisting of a Stilton cheese would probably
be compelled to regard everything outside the
cheese as belonging to the realm of the Infinite. In
reality, if we think of it, all our visions of the infinite
are similarly conditioned. It is only by emphasising
our finiteness that we ever become conscious of the
infinite. The infinite can only be that which stretches
far beyond the boundaries of our own personality. It
is the charm of dreams that they introduce us into a
new infinity. Time and space are annihilated, gravity
is suspended, and we are joyfully borne up in the air,
as it were in the arms of angels; we are brought into
a deeper communion with Nature, and in dreams a man
listens to the arguments of his dog with as little surprise
as Balaam heard the reproaches of his ass. The unexpected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
limitations of our dream world, the exclusion
of so many elements which are present even unconsciously
in waking life, impart a splendid freedom and
ease to the intellectual operations of the sleeping mind,
and an extravagant romance, a poignant tragedy, to
our emotions. 'He has never known happiness,' said
Lamb, speaking out of his own experience, 'who has
never been mad.' And there are many who taste in
dreams a happiness they never know when awake.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>
In the waking moments of our complex civilised life
we are ever in a state of suspense which makes all
great conclusions impossible; the multiplicity of the
facts of life, always present to consciousness, restrains
the free play of logic (except for that happy dreamer,
the mathematician), and surrounds most of our pains
and nearly all our pleasures with infinite qualifications;
we are tied down to a sober tameness. In our dreams
the fetters of civilisation are loosened, and we know
the fearful joy of freedom.</p>

<p>In this way the Paradise of dreams has been a
reservoir from which men have always drawn consolation
and sweet memory and hope, even belief, the
imagination and gratification of desires that the world
restrained, the promise and proof of the dearest and
deepest aspirations.</p>

<p>Yet, while there is thus a real sense in which dreams
produce their effect by the retraction of the field of
consciousness and the limitation of the psychic activities
which mark ordinary life, it remains true that if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
we take into account the complete psychic life of dreaming,
subconscious as well as conscious, it is waking, not
sleeping, life which may be said to be limited.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> Thus it
is, as we have seen, that the most fundamental and the
most primitive forms of psychic life, as well as the rarest
and the most abnormal, all seem to have their prototype
in the vast world of dreams. Sleep, Vaschide has
said, is not, as Homer thought, the brother of Death,
but of Life, and, it may be added, the elder brother.</p>

<p>'We dream, see visions, converse with chim&aelig;ras,'
said Joseph Glanvill, the seventeenth-century philosopher;
'the one half of our life is a romance, a
fiction.' And what of the other half? Pepys tells us
how another distinguished man of the same century,
Sir William Petty, 'proposed it as a thing that is truly
questionable whether there really be any difference
between waking and dreaming.'<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> Our dreams are said
to be delusions, constituted in much the same way as
the delusion of the insane. But, says Godfernaux,
'all life is a series of systematised delusions, more or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
less durable.' Men weary of too much living have
sometimes found consolation in this likeness of the
world of dreams to the world of life. 'When thou hast
roused thyself from sleep thou hast perceived that they
were only dreams which troubled thee,' wrote the
Imperial Stoic to himself in his <cite>Meditations;</cite> 'now in
thy waking hours look at these things about thee as
thou didst look at those dreams.' Dreams are true
while they last. Can we, at the best, say more of life?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We set out to study as carefully as possible the small
field of dream consciousness belonging to a few persons,
not, it may be, abnormal, of whom it was possible
to speak with some assurance. The great naturalist,
Linn&aelig;us, once said that he could spend a lifetime in
studying as much of the earth as he could cover with
his hand. However small the patch we investigate, it
will lead us back to the sun at last. There is nothing
too minute or too trivial. I have often remembered
with a pang, how, long years ago, I once gave pain by
saying, with the arrogance of boyhood, that it was foolish
to tell one's dreams. I have done penance for that
remark since. 'Il faut cultiver notre jardin,' said the
wise philosopher of the eighteenth century. I have
cultivated, so far as I care to, my garden of dreams, and
it scarcely seems to me that it is a large garden. Yet
every path of it, I sometimes think, might lead at last
to the heart of the universe.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The subdued quality of the light in normal dreaming&mdash;the usual
absence of sunshine and generally even of colour&mdash;has long been noted.
'We never dream of being in the sunshine,' says Henry Dircks (<em>Lancet</em>,
11th June 1870, p. 863), though too absolutely; 'light and shade form
no requisite elements.... The liveliest and most impressive dream is,
in reality, a true night scene, very dubiously lighted up, and in which the
nearest objects are those which we principally observe and which most
interest us.'</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> As some writers give a rather special meaning to the word 'consciousness,'
I may say that I simply mean by it (as defined by Baldwin and Stout
in the <cite>Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology</cite>) 'the distinctive character
of whatever may be called mental life,' or, as Professor Stratton puts it,
in defence of this broad definition (<cite>Psychological Bulletin</cite>, April 1906),
'consciousness designates the common and generic feature of our psychic
acts.' Dreaming then becomes, as defined by Baldwin and Stout, 'conscious
process during sleep.' It should be added that there is much
uncertainty about any definition of consciousness. Bode ('Some Recent
Definitions of Consciousness,' <cite>Psychological Review</cite>, July 1908) thinks it
'a matter for legitimate doubt' whether any definition of consciousness
can be adequate, and Mercier (art. 'Consciousness' in Tuke's <cite>Dictionary of
Psychological Medicine</cite>) boldly proclaims&mdash;quite justly, I think&mdash;that
'consciousness is not susceptible of definition,' for we can never go behind
it or outside it. That we have to admit various kinds, or at all events
various degrees, of consciousness will become clear in our discussion of
dreaming.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> By 'subconscious' is meant, as defined by Baldwin and Stout, 'not
clearly recognised in a present state of consciousness, yet entering into the
development of subsequent states of consciousness.' Some psychologists
strongly dislike the word 'subconscious.' They are even disposed to
argue that there is no subconscious mind, and that before and after the
stage of 'awareness,' psychic facts only exist as 'dispositions of brain
cells.' The psychologist, however, as such, has no concern with brain cells
which belong to the histologist. When we occupy ourselves with dreams
we realise at every step that it is possible for psychic states to exist and to
affect our 'awareness,' while at the same time they are not immediately
within the sphere of that 'awareness.' Psychic states of this kind seem
most properly termed 'subconscious,' that is to say slightly, partially, or
imperfectly conscious. Any objection to so precise and convenient a term
for a real phenomenon seems, indeed, to belong to the sphere of personal
idiosyncrasy into which we have perhaps no right to intrude.</p></div>

known, and was referred to by the writer of an article on 'Dreams and

<p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> The old French case (quoted by Macnish) of a woman, with a portion
of her skull removed, whose brain bulged out during dreams but was
motionless in dreamless sleep, as well as the more recent similar case known
to Hammond (<cite>Treatise on Insanity</cite>, p. 233), supports the belief that the
psychic activity which is not manifested in rememberable dreams is probably
at the most of a very shadowy character. Even during waking life
psychic activity often falls to a very low ebb; Beaunis, who has investigated
this question ('Comment Fonctionne mon Cerveau,' <cite>Revue Philosophique</cite>,
January 1909), describes a condition which he names 'psychic twilight'
and regards as frequently occurring.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> Lucretius long ago referred to the significance of this fact (lib. iv.
vv. 988-994), and he stated that the hallucination persisted for a time even
after the dog had awakened. I have never myself been able to see any
trace of such hypnagogic hallucination or delusion in dogs who awake from
dreams, though I have frequently looked for it; it always seems to me
that the dog who seemingly awakes from a dream of hunting grasps the
fireside facts of life around him immediately and easily.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> This classification of the sources of dreams has, however, been generally
accepted for little more than a century. At an earlier period it was not
usually believed to cover the whole ground. Thus Des Laurens (A.
Laurentius) in the sixteenth century, in his treatise on the Disease of
Melancholy (insanity), says that there are three kinds of dreams: (1) of
Nature (<em>i.e.</em> due to external causes); (2) of the mind (<em>i.e.</em> based on memories);
and, above both these classes, (3) dreams from God and the devil.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> The simile of the kaleidoscope for the most elementary process of
dreaming has often suggested itself. Thus in an article on dreaming in
the <cite>Lancet</cite> (24th November 1877) we read: 'The combinations are new,
but the materials are old, some recent, many remote and forgotten....
The turn of the kaleidoscope is instantaneous and any new idea thrown
into the field, perhaps in the act of turning, becomes an integral part of
the picture.'</p></div>

regards attention as possible in dreams, but fails to distinguish between
different kinds of attention.</p></div>

As regards the importance of the absence of voluntary attention in the
production of visual images, it may be remarked that even the after-image
of a bright object in waking life is much more vivid when it occurs in a
state of inattention and distraction. I noticed this phenomenon some
years ago, especially when studying mescal, and in recent years it has been
recorded by J. H. Hyslop (<cite>Psychological Review</cite>, May 1903).</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> We must be cautious in assuming that such imagery is purely retinal.
Scripture ('Cerebral light,' <cite>Studies from the Yale Psychological Laboratory</cite>,
vol. v., 1899) argues that even the so-called 'retinal light' or '<em>eigenlicht</em>'
is cerebral, not retinal at all, since it is single and not double, and differs
from after-images, which are displaced by pressure on eyeball. This view
is perhaps too extreme in the opposite direction.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_20_20" id="Footnote_20_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> For a full and interesting study of these, see S. J. Franz, 'After-images'
(Monograph Supplements to <cite>Psychological Review</cite>, vol. iii., No. 2, June
1899). He agrees with those who regard after-images as entirely retinal in
origin.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_22_22" id="Footnote_22_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> G. E. Partridge, however ('Reverie,' <cite>Pedagogical Seminary</cite>, April
1898), has investigated hypnagogic phenomena in 826 children. They
were asked to describe what they saw at night with closed eyes before
falling asleep. Among these children 58&middot;5 per cent. of those aged from
thirteen to sixteen saw things at night in this way; of those aged six the
proportion was higher, 64&middot;2 per cent. There seemed to be a maximum at
about the age of ten, and probably another maximum at a much earlier
age. Stars were most frequently mentioned, being spoken of by 151
children, colours by 145, people and faces 77, animals 31, scenes of the day
21, flowers and fruit 18, pictures 15, God and angels 13. Partridge calls
these phenomena hypnagogic; while, however, the hypnagogic visions of
adults may well be a relic of children's visions, the latter have much
greater range and vitality, for they are not confined to the moment before
sleep, and the child sometimes has a certain amount of control over them.
E. Guyon has studied hypnagogic and allied visions in children in his Paris
thesis, <cite>Sur les Hallucinations Hypnagogiques</cite>, 1903. He believes that children
always find them terrifying. That, however, is far from being the case and
is merely due to a pre-occupation with morbid cases, which naturally attract
most attention. (This is also illustrated by the examples given by Stanley
Hall, 'A Study of Fears,' <cite>American Journal of Psychology</cite>, 1897, pp. 186
<em>et seq.</em>) The visions of the healthy child are not terrifying, and he accepts
them in a completely matter-of-course way. He is no more puzzled or
troubled by his waking dreams than by his sleeping dreams.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_23_23" id="Footnote_23_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> The earliest detailed, though not typical, description of this phenomenon
I have met with is by Dr. Simon Forman, the astrologer, in his
entertaining <cite>Autobiography</cite>, written in 1600. He says that, as a child of six,
'So soon as he was always laid down to sleep he should see in visions
always many mighty mountains and hills come rolling against him, as
though they would overrun him and fall on him and bruise him, yet he
got up always to the top of them and with much ado went over them.
Then should he see many great waters like to drown him, boiling and
raging against him as though they would swallow him up, yet he thought
he did overpass them. And these dreams and visions he had every night
continually for three or four years' space.' He believed they were sent
him by God to signify the troubles of his later years. De Quincey accurately
described the phenomenon in 1821, in his <cite>Confessions of an English
Opium-Eater:</cite> 'I know not whether my reader is aware, that many
children, perhaps most, have a power of painting, as it were, upon the
darkness, all sorts of phantoms: in some, that power is simply a mechanic
affection of the eye; others have a voluntary or a semi-voluntary power to
dismiss or to summon them, or, as a child once said to me when I questioned
him on this matter, "I can tell them to go and they go; but sometimes
they come, when I don't tell them to come."' E. H. Clarke (<cite>Visions</cite>,
1878, pp. 212-216) discussed the ability of children to see visions, and
pointed out the element of will in this ability. It seems unusual for
auditory impressions to intrude, though J. A. Symonds (biography by
Horatio Brown, vol. i. p. 7), in describing his own night-terrors as a child,
speaks of phantasmal voices which blended with the caterwauling of cats
on the roof.</p></div>

common in dreams. I have referred to this point elsewhere (<cite>Studies
in the Psychology of Sex</cite>, vol. i. 3rd ed., p. 193). It is an interesting and
doubtless significant fact that the same transformation is accepted in
the myths of primitive peoples. Thus, according to H. H. Bancroft
(<cite>Native Races of the Pacific</cite>, vol. i. p. 93), a pantomime dance of the
Aleuts represents the transformation of a captive bird into a lovely
woman who falls exhausted into the arms of the hunter.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_32_32" id="Footnote_32_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32_32"><span class="label">[32]</span></a> It is noteworthy that this marked tendency in dreams to discover
analogies, although doubtless a tendency of primitive thought, is also a
progressive tendency. 'The conquests of science,' says Sageret ('L'Analogie
Scientifique,' <cite>Revue Philosophique</cite>, January 1909), 'are the conquests
of analogy.'</p></div>

November 1904), in opposition to Leroy and Tobolowska, goes so far as to
say that 'the sense of the dream, the interpretation of the image, is given
in the image, before the image, if one may say so; we are not concerned
with a mere procession of images without internal connection, but are
introduced into a pre-established organisation; wholes are decomposed
and not separate elements united.' We have to remember that in dream
life as in waking life the action is twofold; in either world when our psychic
activity is of low intensity we combine external images into a fairly objective
picture; when psychic activity is intense external images are
subdued and controlled by that activity.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_47_47" id="Footnote_47_47"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47_47"><span class="label">[47]</span></a> A somewhat similar mistaken self-detachment may even occur momentarily
in the waking condition. Thus Jastrow (<cite>The Subconscious</cite>, p. 137)
refers to the 'lapse of consciousness' of a lady student who, while absorbed
in her work, heard outside the door the shuffling of rubber heels such as she
herself wore, and said 'There goes&mdash;&mdash;,' naming herself. That delusion
was no doubt due to the eruption of a dream-like state of distraction. As
regards the visual phantasm of the self (which has sometimes been seen by
men of very distinguished intellectual power) it may be noted that it is
favoured by the conditions of dream life. Our dream imagery is all
pictural, sometimes even to dream consciousness, and to see oneself in
the picture is, therefore, not so very much more remarkable than it is in
waking life to come upon oneself among a bundle of photographs.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_48_48" id="Footnote_48_48"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48_48"><span class="label">[48]</span></a> As regards the significance of snakes in dreams, it may be remarked
that the followers of Freud regard them as being, in the dreams of women,
as they are in the speech and myths of primitive peoples, erotic symbols
(<em>e.g.</em> Karl Abraham, <cite>Traum und Mythus</cite>, 1909, p. 19). It must be remembered,
however, that this erotic symbolism is but a small part of the
emotional interest aroused by snakes which are an extremely common
source of fear, especially in the young. See <em>e.g.</em> Stanley Hall, 'A Study of
Fears,' <cite>American Journal of Psychology</cite>, 1897, pp. 205 <em>et seq</em>.</p></div>

going on around him, converses about it, falls asleep again, and imagines

to the philosophy of life set forth by Jules de Gaultier, perhaps the
most subtle and original of living thinkers; according to Gaultier the
psychic improvisation which has created the spectacle of the world has,

assumed, in order to retain the joy of an unending play of the

Tannery (<cite>Revue Philosophique</cite>, October 1898), 'the various organisms
of the brain which in the waking state accomplish distinct functions with
satisfactory agreement are, on the contrary, in a state of semi-independence.'
There is, in Greenwood's words (<cite>Imagination in Dreams</cite>, p. 41),
a 'loosening of mental bonds,' corresponding to the relaxation of muscular
tension which also occurs before going to sleep.</p></div>

'Hysteria,' says Janet (<cite>The Major Symptoms of Hysteria</cite>, 1907, p. 332),

in the less profound states of mental confusion, when, as Bolton

<p><a name="Footnote_56_56" id="Footnote_56_56"></a><a href="#FNanchor_56_56"><span class="label">[56]</span></a> Although I reached this conclusion independently, as a result of the
analysis of dream experiences, I find that it was set forth at a much earlier
period by Wundt. 'Men are accustomed to regard most of the phantasms
of dreams as hallucinations,' he writes (<cite>Grundz&uuml;ge der Physiologischer
Psychologie</cite>, vol. iii.), 'but most dream representations are apparently
illusions, initiated by the slight sensory impressions which are never
extinguished in sleep.' Weygandt, in his brief but excellent book, <cite>Entstehung
der Tra&auml;me</cite>, fully adopts this view, although I scarcely think he is
always successful in his attempts to demonstrate it by his own dreams;
such demonstration is necessarily often difficult or impossible because,
apart from the dream itself, we seldom know what sensory impressions are
persisting in our sleep. C. M. Giessler (<cite>Die Physiologische Beziehungen der
Traumvorg&auml;nge</cite>, 1896, p. 2), who also proceeds from Wundt, likewise regards
dreams as in general the more or less orderly and successive revival of
psychic vestiges of waking life, conditioned by inner or outer excitations.
Tissi&eacute; (in <cite>Les R&ecirc;ves</cite>, 1898), again, declares that 'dreams of purely psychic
origin do not exist,' and Beaunis (<cite>American Journal of Psychology</cite>,
July-October 1903) also believes that all dreams need an internal or external
stimulus from the organism.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_57_57" id="Footnote_57_57"></a><a href="#FNanchor_57_57"><span class="label">[57]</span></a> Thus W. S. Monroe ('Mental Elements of Dreams,' <cite>Journal of Philosophy</cite>,
23rd November 1905) found that in nearly three hundred dreams
of fifty-five women students of the Westfield Normal College (Massachusetts),
visual imagery appeared in sixty-seven per cent. dreams, auditory
in twenty-six per cent., tactile in eight per cent., motor in five per cent.,
olfactory in a little over one per cent., and gustatory in rather under one
per cent. In the results of observation recorded by Sarah Weed and
Florence Hallam (<cite>American Journal of Psychology</cite>, April 1896) the sensory
imagery appears in the same order of frequency and approximately in the
same proportions.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_58_58" id="Footnote_58_58"></a><a href="#FNanchor_58_58"><span class="label">[58]</span></a> In another case, a sensation of irritation in the palm led to a dream of
being scratched by a cat. Guthrie mentions (<cite>Clinical Journal</cite>, 7th June
1899) that as a child he used to dream of being tortured by savages by
being slowly tickled under the arms when unable to move; he sweated
much at night, and considers that the tickling thus caused was the source
of the dreams.</p></div>

at Westfield Normal School a crushed clove was placed on the tongue for
ten successive nights on going to bed. Of 254 dreams reported as following
there were seventeen taste dreams and eight smell dreams, and three of
these dreams actually involved cloves. The clove also influenced dreams
of other classes; thus, as a result of the burning sensation in the mouth,
one dreamer imagined that the house was on fire (W. S. Monroe, 'A Study
of Taste Dreams,' <cite>American Journal of Psychology</cite>, January 1899). It has
indeed been found, by Meunier, specially easy to apply olfactory stimuli
during sleep and so improve the emotional tone (R. Meunier, 'A Propos
d'oniroth&eacute;rapie,' <cite>Archives de Neurologie</cite>, March 1910). Meunier found
that in his own case tuberose always called out agreeable dreams full of
detail, though in another subject the dreams were always unpleasant. In
hysterical subjects essence of geranium provoked various agreeable dreams
followed by a pleasant emotional tone during the following day.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_78_78" id="Footnote_78_78"></a><a href="#FNanchor_78_78"><span class="label">[78]</span></a> This question is, for instance, asked by F. H. Bradley ('On the Failure
of Movement in Dreams,' <cite>Mind</cite>, 1894, p. 373). The explanation he prefers
is that the dream vision is out of relation to the very dimly conscious actual
position of the body, so that the information necessary to complete the
idea of the movement is wanting. Only as regards the less complicated
movements of lips, tongue, or finger, when the motor idea is in harmony
with the actual position of the body movements, does movement take
place. We have no means of distinguishing the real world from the world of
our vision; 'our images thus move naturally to realise themselves in the
world of our real limbs. But the world and its arrangement is for the
moment out of connection with our ideas, and hence the attempt at motion
for the most part must fail.' It is quite true that this conflict is an important
factor in dreaming, but it fails to apply to the large number of
movements which we dream of actually doing.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_79_79" id="Footnote_79_79"></a><a href="#FNanchor_79_79"><span class="label">[79]</span></a> The action of some drugs produces a state in this respect resembling
that which prevails in dreams. 'Under the influence of a large dose of
haschisch,' Professor Stout remarks (<cite>Analytic Psychology</cite>, vol. i. p. 14),
'I found myself totally unable to distinguish between what I actually did
and saw, and what I merely thought about.' Not only are the motor and
sensory activities relatively dormant, but the central activity is perfectly
able, and content, to dispense with their services. 'Thought,' as Jastrow
says (<cite>Fact and Fable in Psychology</cite>, p. 386), 'is but more or less successfully
suppressed action.'</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_80_80" id="Footnote_80_80"></a><a href="#FNanchor_80_80"><span class="label">[80]</span></a> This seems to me to be the answer to the question, asked by Freud,
(<cite>Die Traumdeutung</cite>, p. 227), why we do not always dream of inhibited
movement. Freud considers that the idea of inhibited movement, when it
occurs in dreams, has no relation to the actual condition of the dreamer's
nervous system, but is simply an ideatory symbol of an erotic wish that is
no longer capable of fulfilment. But it is certain that sleep is not always
at the same depth and that the various nervous groups are not always
equally asleep. A dream arising on the basis of partial and imperfect sleep
can scarcely fail to lead to the attempt at actual movement and the more
or less complete inhibition of that movement, presenting a struggle which
is often visible to the onlooker, and is not purely ideatory.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_81_81" id="Footnote_81_81"></a><a href="#FNanchor_81_81"><span class="label">[81]</span></a> This explanation, based on the depth and kind of the sleep, is entirely
distinct from the theory of Aliotta (<cite>Il Pensiero e la Personalit&agrave; nei Sogni</cite>,
1905), who believes that dreamers differ according to their nervous type, the
person of visual type assisting passively at the spectacle of his dreams,
while the person of motor type takes actual part in them. I have no
evidence of this, though I believe that dreams differ in accordance with the
dreamer's personal type.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_82_82" id="Footnote_82_82"></a><a href="#FNanchor_82_82"><span class="label">[82]</span></a> Dugald Stewart argued that there is loss of control over the muscular
system during sleep, and the body, therefore, is not subject to our command;
volition is present but it cannot influence the limbs. Hammond argued,
on the contrary, that Stewart was quite wrong; the reason why voluntary
movements are not performed during sleep is, he said, that volition is
suspended. 'We do not will our actions when we are asleep. We imagine
that we do, and that is all' (<cite>Treatise on Insanity</cite>, p. 205). Dugald Stewart
and Hammond, though their phraseology may have been too metaphysical,
were, from the standpoint I have adopted, both maintaining tenable
positions. In one type of dream, we imagine we easily achieve all sorts of
difficult and complicated actions, but in reality we make no movement;
the ease and rapidity with which the mental machine moves is due to the
fact that it is ungeared, and is effecting no work at all. In the other type
of dream we make violent but inadequate efforts at movement and only
partially succeed; the machine is partially geared, in a state intermediate
between deep sleep and the waking condition.</p></div>

dreams; R&eacute;gis and Lalanne (<cite>International Medical Congress</cite>, 1900;

'functional rest of the sensory centres and of the apperception centre,'
resulting in heightened latent energy which lends unusual strength to
excitations, as a secondary condition of the dream state. K&uuml;lpe (<cite>Outline
of Psychology</cite>, p. 212) argues that the existence of vivid dreams shows that
fatigue with its diminished associability fails to affect the central sensations
themselves; this increased excitability resulting from dissociation
may itself, however, be regarded as a symptom of fatigue; hyperaesthesia
and anaesthesia are alike signs of exhaustion.</p></div>

testifies to its emotional potency. Delboeuf states that a friend of his
experienced a dream so terrible in its emotional strain that on awaking his
black hair was found to have turned completely white.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_87_87" id="Footnote_87_87"></a><a href="#FNanchor_87_87"><span class="label">[87]</span></a> The fundamental character of emotion in dreams has been more or
less clearly recognised by various investigators. Thus C. L. Herrick, who
studied his own dreams for many months, found that the essential element
is the emotional, and not the ideational, and that, indeed, when recalled
<em>at once</em>, with closed eyes and before moving, they were nearly devoid of
intellectual content (<cite>Journal of Comparative Neurology</cite>, vol. iii. p. 17, 1893).
R. MacDougall considers that dreaming is 'a succession of intense states
of feeling supported by a minimum of ideational content,' or, as he says
again, more accurately, 'the feeling is primary; the idea-content is the
inferred thing' (<cite>Psychological Review</cite>, vol. v. p. 2). Grace Andrews, who kept
a record of her dreams (<cite>American Journal of Psychology</cite>, October 1900),
found that dream emotions are often stronger and more vivid than those
of waking life; 'the dream emotion seems to me the most real element of
the dream life.' P. Meunier, again ('Des R&ecirc;ves St&eacute;reotyp&eacute;s,' <cite>Journal de
Psychologie Normale et Pathologique</cite>, September-October 1905), states that
'the substratum of a dream consists of a cœn&aelig;sthesia or an emotional state.
The intellectual operation which translates to the sleeper's consciousness,
while he is asleep, this cœn&aelig;sthesia or emotional state is what we call a
dream.'</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_88_88" id="Footnote_88_88"></a><a href="#FNanchor_88_88"><span class="label">[88]</span></a> The night-terrors of children have frequently been found to have their
origin in gastric or intestinal disturbance. Graham Little brings together
the opinions of various authorities on this point, though he is himself
inclined to give chief importance to heart disease producing slight disturbances
of breathing, since he has found that in nearly two-thirds of his
cases (17 out of 30) night-terrors were associated with early heart disease
(Graham Little, 'The Causation of Night-Terrors,' <cite>British Medical Journal</cite>,
19th August 1899). It should be added that night-terrors are more usually
divided into two classes: (1) idiopathic (purely cerebral in origin), and
(2) symptomatic (due to reflex disturbance caused by various local disorders);
see <em>e.g.</em> Guthrie, 'On Night-Terrors,' <cite>Clinical Journal</cite>, 7th January
1899. J. A. Symonds has well described his own night-terrors as a child
(Horatio Brown, <cite>J. A. Symonds</cite>, vol. i.). Lafcadio Hearn (in a paper on
'Nightmare-Touch' in <cite>Shadowings</cite>) also gives a vivid account of his own
childish night-terrors.</p></div>

Hobbes: 'As anger causeth heat in some parts of the body when we are
awake; so when we sleep the overheating of the same parts causeth
anger, and raiseth up in the brain the imagination of an enemy. In the
same manner as natural kindness, when we are awake, causeth desire
and desire makes heat in certain other parts of the body; so also, too much
heat in those parts, while we sleep, raiseth in the brain an imagination of
some kindness shown. In sum, our dreams are the reverse of our waking
imaginations; the motion, when we are awake, beginning at one end,
and when we dream at another' (<cite>Leviathan</cite>, Part 1. ch. 2).</p></div>

emotions,' remarks Mercier (art. 'Consciousness,' Tuke's <cite>Dictionary
of Psychological Medicine</cite>), 'are attended by a definite feeling of misery
which is referred in every case to the epigastrium.' He adds that the
pleasures of success and good repute, aesthetic enjoyment, etc., are also
attended by a definite feeling in the same region. This fact indicates the
extreme vagueness of organic sensation. There is in fact much uncertainty
and great difference of opinion as to the nature, and even the existence,
of organic sensation; see <em>e.g.</em> a careful summary of the chief views by
Dr. Elsie Murray, 'Organic Sensation,' <cite>American Journal of Psychology</cite>,

always associated with headache or any other recognisable condition.
They constitute a very common type of dream not quite easy to explain.
Dr. Savage mentions, for instance, that in his own case scarcely a week
passes without such a dream, though in real life he scarcely ever loses a
train and never worries about it. Wundt considers that the dreams in
which we seek something we cannot find or have left something behind are
due to indefinite coenaesthesic disturbances involving feelings of the same
emotional tone, such as an uncomfortable position or a slight irregularity
of respiration. I have myself independently observed the same connection,
though it is not invariably traceable.</p></div>

flying, though he put forward the explanation in too fanciful a form and
failed to realise that other factors, notably a change in skin pressure, are
also involved. Str&uuml;mpell at a later date recognised this explanation, as

<p><a name="Footnote_112_112" id="Footnote_112_112"></a><a href="#FNanchor_112_112"><span class="label">[112]</span></a> It is the same with chloroform. 'There are marked sensations in the
vicinity of the heart,' says Elmer Jones ('The Waning of Consciousness
under Chloroform,' <cite>Psychological Review</cite>, January 1909). 'The musculature
of that organ seems thoroughly stimulated, and the contractions
become violent and accelerated. The palpitations are as strong as would
be experienced at the close of some violent bodily exertion.' It is significant,
also, as bearing on the interpretation of the dream of flying, that
under chloroform 'all movements made appeared to be much longer than
they actually were. A slight movement of the tongue appeared to be
magnified at least ten times. Clinching the fingers and opening them again
produced the feeling of their moving through a space of several feet.'</p></div>

chloroform intoxication. Thus Elmer Jones found that this sense is, after

It appears to be nowhere, simply floating in space. It is a most
ecstatic feeling.'</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_116_116" id="Footnote_116_116"></a><a href="#FNanchor_116_116"><span class="label">[116]</span></a> Lafcadio Hearn describes the fall as coming at the beginning of the
dream. Dr. Guthrie (<cite>Clinical Journal</cite>, June 7, 1899), in his own case,
describes the flying sensations as coming first and the falling as coming
afterwards, and apparently due to sudden failure of the power of flight;
the first part of the dream is agreeable but after the fall the dreamer awakes
shaken, shocked, and breathless.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_117_117" id="Footnote_117_117"></a><a href="#FNanchor_117_117"><span class="label">[117]</span></a> The disagreeable nature of falling in dreams may probably be connected
with the absence of rhythm usually present in dreams of flying.
Most of the psychologists who have occupied themselves with rhythm
have insisted on its pleasurable emotional tone, as leading to a state
bordering on ecstasy (see <em>e.g.</em> J. B. Miner, 'Motor, Visual, and Applied
Rhythms,' Monograph Supplement to <cite>Psychological Review</cite>, June 1903).
The pleasure is especially marked, as MacDougall remarks, when there is
'a coincidence of subjective and objective change.' In dreams of flying
we have this coincidence, the real subjective rhythm being transformed
in consciousness to an objective rhythm.</p></div>

falling have an aural origin, and are caused by contraction of the stapedius
muscle, leading to a change in the ampullae which might suggest descent;
he has himself suddenly awakened from such a dream and caught the sound
of the muscular contraction. The opinion of so acute an investigator deserves

apparently capricious, and may be regarded as an anomaly comparable to a
synaesthesia. Heine was an example of this, and he has described in
<cite>Florentine Nights</cite> the visions aroused by the playing of Paganini, and
elsewhere the visions evoked in him by the music of Berlioz. Though I
do not myself experience this phenomenon, I have found that there is
sometimes a tendency for music to arouse ideas of motor imagery; thus
some melodies of Handel suggest a giant painting frescoes on a vast wall
space. The most elementary motor relationship of music is seen in the
tendency of many people to sway portions of their body&mdash;to 'beat time'&mdash;in
sympathy with the music. (This phenomenon has been experimentally
studied by J. B. Miner, 'Motor, Visual, and Applied Rhythms,' Monograph
Supplement to the <cite>Psychological Review</cite>, vol. v., No. 4, June 1903). Music
is fundamentally an audible dance, and the most primitive music is dance
music.</p></div>

persists even in sleep. Thus Weygandt relates that he once fell asleep in
the theatre during one of the last scenes of <cite>Cavalleria Rusticana</cite>, when the
tenor was singing in ever higher and higher tones, and dreamed that in
order to reach the notes the performer was climbing up ladders and stairs
on the stage.</p></div>

J. S. Bach</cite> (1907), and also Albert Schweitzer, <cite>J. S. Bach</cite> (1908), especially
chapters xix.-xxiii. 'Concrete things,' says Ernest Newman, summarising
some of these results (<cite>Nation</cite>, December 25, 1909), 'incessantly suggested
abstract ideas or inward moods to Bach, and <em>vice vers&acirc;</em>. He would time
after time use the same musical formula for the same word or idea. He
first suggests the external concepts of "high" and "low," as other composers
have done, by high or low notes, and motion up or down by ascending
or descending themes. But Bach correlates with the outward, objective
thing a whole series of things that are purely subjective. Thus moods of
elation or of depression are to him the mental equivalents of the physical
acts of going up or down. So he gives us a whole series of ascending
themes to words that express "mounting" states of mind, as it were&mdash;such
as pride, courage, strength, resolution&mdash;and descending themes to
words that express "declining" states of mind&mdash;such as prostration,
adoration, depression, discouragement, grief at sin, humility, poverty,
fatigue, and illness. For the two sets of concepts, internal and external,
he will use the same musical symbols. To represent the physical concept
of "surrounding," again, he adopts the device of a circling or undulating
theme. A crown or a garland suggests the same idea to him, so for this,
too, he uses the same kind of theme. But the correspondence goes still
further; for when he comes to the word "considering," he uses the same
curving musical symbol once more&mdash;his notion of "considering" being
that of looking round on all sides. Again, a word of purely external
signification that suggests something twisted will have an appropriately
twisted theme. Then come the subjective applications of the theme&mdash;the
same disordered melodic outline is used to express a frame of mind
like anxiety or confusion, or to depict the wiles of Satan. Careful study
of the vocal works of Bach, and especially of the cantatas, has revealed a
host of these curious symbols.' The whole subject, it may be added, has
been briefly and suggestively discussed by Goblot, 'La Musique Descriptive,'
<cite>Revue Philosophique</cite>, July 1901.</p></div>

(<cite>Les R&ecirc;ves et les Moyens de les Diriger</cite>, p. 356, quoted by Vaschide and
Pi&eacute;ron, <cite>Psychologie du R&ecirc;ve</cite>, p. 26), tentatively put forward a symbolic
theory of dreams, as a possible rival to the theory that permanent associations
are set up as the result of a first chance coincidence. 'Do there
exist,' he asked, 'bizarre analogies of internal sensations in virtue of
which certain vibrations of the nerves, certain instinctive movements of
our viscera, correspond to sensations apparently quite different? According
to this hypothesis experience would bring to light mysterious affinities,
the knowledge of which might become a genuine science;... and a
real key to dreams would not be an unrealisable achievement if we could
bring together and compare a sufficient number of observations.'</p></div>

Thus the Psychical Research Society's Committee on Hallucinations
recognised a symbolic group, and recorded, for instance, the case of a man
who, when his child lies dying, sees a blue flame in the air and hears a voice
say, 'That's his soul' (<cite>Proceedings Society for Psychical Research</cite>, August
1894, p. 125).</p></div>

modes of psychic activity is due to 'vague thinking in a condition of

same or allied conditions exist. In hallucinations, which (as Parish and
others have shown) tend to occur in hypnagogic or sleep-like states, the
conditions are clearly the same. The symbolism of an art, and notably
music, is due to the very conditions of the art, which exclude any appeal
to other senses. The primitive mind reaches symbolism through a similar
condition of things, coming as the result of ignorance and undeveloped
powers of apperception. In insanity these powers are morbidly disturbed
or destroyed, with the same result.</p></div>

emotional aspects and in the emotional transformation of actual sensory
stimuli, from without or from within the organism. The size of objects
recalled by dreaming memory usually remains unchanged, and if changed
it seems to be more usually diminished. 'Lilliputian hallucinations,'
as they are termed by Leroy, who has studied them (<cite>Revue de Psychiatrie</cite>,
1909, No. 8), in which diminutive, and frequently coloured, people are
observed, may also occasionally occur in alcoholic and chloral intoxication,
in circular insanity, and in various other morbid mental conditions. They
are usually agreeable in character.</p></div>

'when threatened by a gastric or intestinal attack dream of seeing fish.
The late Professor Sergius Botkine told me that he had found this coincidence
in his own case, and I have myself several times found it in the
case of a young girl who is well known to me. Some have supposed that
the sleeping consciousness receives an impression of the elongated shape
of the stomach or intestine; but such a supposition is easier to make than
to prove.' Scherner associated dreams of fish with sensations arising from
the bladder, and here also it may be said that we are concerned with a
fish-like viscus. Greenwood (<cite>Imagination in Dreams</cite>, p. 195) stated that
he had always been subject, at intervals of months or years, to a recurrent
dream in which he would see a river swarming with fish that were finally
piled in a horrible sweltering mass; this dream always left a feeling
of 'squalid horror,' but he was never able to ascertain its cause and significance.</p></div>

wishes are obviously the motor force in building up visionary structures.
Freud attaches great importance to reverie, for he considers that it furnishes
the key to the comprehension of dreams (<em>e.g.</em> <cite>Sammlung Kleiner
Schriften zur Neurosenlehre</cite>, 2nd series, pp. 138 <em>et seq.</em>, 197 <em>et seq.</em>). But
it must be remembered that day-dreaming is not real dreaming, which
takes place under altogether different physiological conditions, although
it may quite fairly be claimed that day-dreaming represents a state intermediate
between ordinary waking consciousness and consciousness during

this phenomenon: 'Every one, I suppose, is subject to a trick of mind
which often puzzles me. I am reading or thinking, and at a moment,
without any association or suggestion that I can discover, there rises
before me the vision of a place I know. Impossible to explain why that
particular spot should show itself to my mind's eye; the cerebral impulse
is so subtle that no search may trace its origin.' Gissing proceeds to say
that a thought, a phrase, an odour, a touch, a posture of the body, may
possibly have furnished the link of association, but he knows no evidence

as well as Clapar&egrave;de. The last remarks that Freud might regard a fear as
a suppressed desire, but it may equally be said that a desire involves, on
its reverse side, a fear. Freud has indeed himself pointed out (<em>e.g.</em> <cite>Jahrbuch
f&uuml;r Psychoanalytische Forschungen</cite>, Bd. 1., 1909, p. 362) that fears
may be instinctively combined with wishes; he regards the association
with a wish of an opposing fear as one of the components of some morbid
psychic states. But he holds that the wish is the positive and fundamental
element: 'The unconscious can only wish' ('Das Unbewusste kann nichts

doubtless a spontaneous muscular contraction excited by the pressure

many survivals of this tendency to objectify subjective impressions.
Thus Mr. Theodore Schroeder has shown (<cite>Free Press Anthology</cite>, 1909,
pp. 171 <em>et seq.</em>) that the prosecutions which have in various so-called
civilised countries pursued many estimable and even noble works of
literature, science, and art are based on the primitive notion that 'indecency'
resides in the object and not in the person who experiences the
feeling, and who ought, therefore, alone to be suppressed, if suppression
is called for. This psychological fallacy continues to subsist, though it
was unmasked in the clearest manner even by St. Paul (<em>e.g.</em> Romans
xiv. 14). It is somewhat analogous to the medi&aelig;val conception
of the criminality of animals.</p></div>

(<cite>Analytic Psychology</cite>, vol. ii. p. 145) of the conflict of systems in apperception,
and of the suspense and deadlock which occur when two or more
systems come into conflict in such a way that the success of one is the
defeat of the other. The discussion is full of interest from its undesigned
bearing on the phenomena of dreaming.</p></div>

dreams of this type. I am not here concerned with the causation of this
type of dream. Perhaps, as Wundt believes, it is due to some physical
discomfort of the sleeper, such as a cramped position, expressing itself
symbolically.</p></div>

life are not necessarily always of the type here described, as may be illustrated
by the dream already brought forward on p. 83, which, it is worth

<p><a name="Footnote_181_181" id="Footnote_181_181"></a><a href="#FNanchor_181_181"><span class="label">[181]</span></a> It is well known, and has often been pointed out (by Weygandt, Sante
de Sanctis, Jewell, etc., and perhaps first by T. Beddoes in his <cite>Hygeia</cite>,
1803, vol. iii. p. 88), that while in childhood all the emotions of the past
day are at once echoed in dreams, after adolescence, this is not so in the
case of intense emotions, which do not emerge in dreams until after a more
or less considerable interval. Marie de Manac&eacute;&iuml;ne and Sante de Sanctis
attribute this to exhaustion of the emotion which needs a period of repair
and organic synthesis before it can repeat itself. Vaschide believed that we
dream of recent events in shallow sleep and of remote events in deep sleep;
this sounds plausible, but will scarcely account for all the phenomena.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_182_182" id="Footnote_182_182"></a><a href="#FNanchor_182_182"><span class="label">[182]</span></a> Since the publication of my paper 'On Dreaming of the Dead,' several
psychologists have returned to the subject. Thus Binet (<cite>L'Ann&eacute;e Psychologique</cite>,
2nd year, issued in 1896, p. 848) gave a dream of his own, very
similar to mine of the editor, in which a doctor, dead a month previously,
is talking to him in his room. On Binet expressing surprise at seeing
him, the doctor explains that he had only sent news of his death in order
to see how many people would come to his funeral. Binet has also had
two dreams, similar to that described on p. 200, in which he is walking in
the country with a dead friend, who seems in good health, though the
dreamer knows he will soon die. Foucault (<cite>Le R&ecirc;ve</cite>, p. 128), who, in
accordance with his own theory, regards my dream of the editor as belonging
to the period of awakening, brings forward a dream of his own in which
he saw his father, dead six months before, sitting in a chair; at first this
seems to him a hallucination, but he finally accepts the vision as real. I
have had a number of letters from people who have had dreams of this type.
One correspondent, an anthropologist and folk-lorist of note, says that
his dreams of dead friends are of the type of Mrs. F.'s. Professor N&auml;cke
writes that he has had such dreams (and see also his articles in the <cite>Archiv
f&uuml;r Kriminalanthropologie</cite>, 1903, p. 307, and the <cite>Neurologisches Centralblatt</cite>,
1910, No. 13). One young lady states that, thirteen years after her
mother's death, she still dreams of her as coming to life again or never
having really died. I may add that this type of dream is admirably
illustrated in a series of dreams concerning a dead friend, published in a
letter from a lady to <cite>Borderland</cite>, January 1896, p. 51.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_188_188" id="Footnote_188_188"></a><a href="#FNanchor_188_188"><span class="label">[188]</span></a> This type of dream&mdash;in which the emotion of the day is inverted in
sleep, depressing emotions giving place to exalting emotions, and so on&mdash;is
by some (Griesinger, Lombroso, Sante de Sanctis, etc.), termed the
contrast-dream. The dream is in such a case, Sante de Sanctis remarks,
complementary, having the same significance as a complementary after-image
and indicating a phase of anabolic repair. Thus A. Wiggam (<cite>Pedagogical
Seminary</cite>, June 1909), gives the case of a girl of twenty, who when
tired and restless always has good dreams, while her dreams are bad when
she is well and free from care. It should be added that, as understood
by N&auml;cke ('Ueber Kontrast-Tr&auml;ume' <cite>Archiv f&uuml;r Kriminalanthropologie</cite>,
1907), a contrast-dream is one that is in striking contrast to the dreamer's
ordinary character. In this type of contrast-dream it is not quite clear
that the mechanism is the same, and the contrast may sometimes be accidental.
Thus a dream of being a soldier on a battlefield, with shells
bursting around me, was merely suggested by a passage of Nietzsche, read
in the evening, which contained the words 'the thunders of the battle
of W&ouml;rth,' and the question of contrast or resemblance to my character
and habits was irrelevant.</p></div>

again (<cite>American Journal of Psychology</cite>, January 1905), also considers
that dreams are responsible for primitive man's inability to conceive
of death as ending our association with our friends; he brings forward
evidence, highly significant in this connection, to show that children, on
dreaming of the dead as alive, are influenced in waking life to doubt the
reality of their death. Ruths, also writing since the publication of my
first paper (<cite>Experimental-Untersuchungen &uuml;ber Musikphantome</cite>, 1898,

spontaneous unconscious movement as by a tentative search for clues.
Thus I read one day the words 'the breaking of a goblet by a little black
imp,' and immediately became conscious that I was reminded of something
similar in recent experience, but could not tell what. I asked myself if
it could have been in a dream. In a few moments, however, the memory
recurred to me that two hours previously I had noticed a broken vase,
and casually wondered how it had become broken. Under such circumstances
we are for a time thinking of something, and yet have no conscious
knowledge as to what we are thinking of.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_200_200" id="Footnote_200_200"></a><a href="#FNanchor_200_200"><span class="label">[200]</span></a> Jastrow remarks, somewhat in the same way (<cite>The Subconscious</cite>, p. 93),
that 'a letting down of the effort, a focusing of the mind upon a point
a little or a good deal to one side of the fixation point, distinctly aids the
mental vision.' The process seems, however, to be most effective when
it is automatic, for attention cannot easily relax its own tension. A large
number of the discoveries and solutions of difficulties effected in dreams
are due to this dispersal of attention over a wider field, so enabling the
missing relationship to be detected. See, for instance, some cases recorded
by Newbold (<cite>Psychological Review</cite>, March 1896, p. 132), as of Dr. Hilprecht,
the Assyriologist, who discovered in a dream that two fragments
of tablets he had vainly been endeavouring to decipher, were really parts
of the same tablet.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_201_201" id="Footnote_201_201"></a><a href="#FNanchor_201_201"><span class="label">[201]</span></a> Hypermnesia, or excessive memory, is found in waking life in various
abnormal conditions. It is not uncommon in men of genius; Macaulay
is a well-known example. It scarcely seems, however, an especially
favourable condition for keen intellectual power; the mental machine
that is clogged with unnecessary and unimportant facts can scarcely fail
to work under difficulties. 'Hypermnesia,' remarks Stoddart ('Early
Symptoms of Mental Disease,' <cite>British Medical Journal</cite>, 11th May 1907),
'occurs most frequently in certain cases of idiocy, and in some cases of
chronic mania. One such patient could enumerate all the occasions
when any given medical officer had played tennis since he entered the
institution.' Hypermnesia in dreams has been dealt with by Carl du
Prel, <cite>Philosophy of Mysticism</cite>, vol. ii. ch. i.</p></div>

of a weak recollection, transference to the subconscious sphere of sleep
might involve a temporary disappearance from the conscious waking
sphere.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_203_203" id="Footnote_203_203"></a><a href="#FNanchor_203_203"><span class="label">[203]</span></a> There is a possible interest in the exact length of the interval. Swoboda
(<cite>Die Perioden des Menschlichen Organismus in ihrer psychologischen
und biologischen Bedeutung</cite>, 1904) believes that the recurrence of memories
tends to obey a law of periodicity, so that, for instance, a melody heard
at a concert may recur at a regular interval. I cannot say that I have
myself found evidence of such periodicity, though I have made several
observations on the recurrence of such memories.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_204_204" id="Footnote_204_204"></a><a href="#FNanchor_204_204"><span class="label">[204]</span></a> Similarly, Foucault (<cite>Le R&ecirc;ve</cite>, p. 79) records the dream of a lady concerning
a place called Br&eacute;tigny, near Dijon, though when awake she was
not aware there is such a place there. Elsewhere (p. 214) Foucault also
gives examples of sensations, not consciously perceived in the waking
state, but revived in dream. Beaunis, in his interesting 'Contribution
&agrave; la Psychologie du R&ecirc;ve' (<cite>American Journal of Psychology</cite>, July-Oct.
1903) narrates a dream of his own in which a forgotten or unconscious
memory revived. Many such dreams could easily be brought together.
An often-quoted dream, apparently of this kind (see <em>e.g.</em>, <cite>British Medical
Journal</cite>, 7th April 1900, p. 850), is that of Archbishop Benson who, like
his predecessor, Laud, took an interest in his dreams. He dreamed that
he was suffering severely in his chest, and that his doctor, on being called
in, told him that he had angĭna pectoris. The archbishop in his dream
exclaimed with indignation: 'Angǐna, angǐna!' The dream made
such an impression on him that he looked the matter up, but only found
the ordinary pronunciation, angīna, recorded. A week later he was at
Cambridge, dining in hall at Trinity, and seated next to Munro, the Professor
of Latin, who happened to ask him about the death of Thomas
Arnold. 'He died of angĭna pectoris,' said Benson. Munro smiled grimly
and said softly: 'Of angǐna, as we now call it.' There can be no doubt
that Benson, who was closely in touch with the academic world, had met
with this correction, which is accepted by all modern Latinists, and
'forgotten' it.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_207_207" id="Footnote_207_207"></a><a href="#FNanchor_207_207"><span class="label">[207]</span></a> In a somewhat similar manner the muscular contractions of the
hysterical may disappear during sleep, as may their paralyses and their
anaesthesias, as well as their losses of memory. (These phenomena have
been especially observed and studied by Raymond and Janet, <cite>N&eacute;vroses
et Id&eacute;es Fixes</cite>, vol. ii.) Such characteristics of the sleep of the hysterical
may well be a manifestation of the same tendency which in the sleep of
normal people leads to hypermnesia. In this connection reference may
be made to the interesting opposition between attention and memory
developed by Dr. Marie de Manac&eacute;&iuml;ne ('De l'antagonisme qui existe entre
chaque effort de l'attention et des innervations motrices,' <cite>Atti dell' XI.
Congresso Internazionale Medico</cite>, 1894, Rome, vol. ii., 'Fisiologia,' p. 48).
Concentrated attention, she argues, paralyses memory, and there is an
absolute antagonism between motor innervation, or real movement,
which favours memory, and the concentrated effort which favours attention.
'In psychological researches we must always separate the phenomena
of memory from the phenomena of attention, for memory is only
possible through muscular movement, and attention, on the contrary, is
only active through the suppression of movement.' In sleep, it is true,
there may be no actual movement, but there is relaxation of muscular
tension and freedom of motor ideas. It should be added that not all
investigators confirm Manac&eacute;&iuml;ne's conclusion as to the antagonism between
the conditions for memory and attention. Thus R. MacDougall ('The
Physical Characteristics of Attention,' <cite>Psychological Review</cite>, March 1895),
while finding that muscular relaxation accompanies the recall of memories,
finds also, though not so markedly and constantly, a similar relaxation
accompanying both voluntary and spontaneous attention.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_211_211" id="Footnote_211_211"></a><a href="#FNanchor_211_211"><span class="label">[211]</span></a> Dr. Marie de Manac&eacute;&iuml;ne, who has studied the phenomena of the
hypnagogic state experimentally in much detail (<cite>Sleep</cite>, pp. 195-220), finds
that in its deepest stage it is marked by echolalia, or the tendency to repeat
automatically what is said, and in a less deep stage by abnormal suggestibility
or the tendency to accept ideas and especially emotions. She
considers that the hypnagogic state becomes abnormal when it lasts for
more than fifteen seconds. It may last for more than six minutes, and
is then of serious import. She shows reason to believe that the hypnagogic
state is substantially identical with the hypnotic state, and she
regards it as probably due to cerebral anaemia. She finds it especially
marked in children under fifteen, the more so if they belong to the working-class,
and rather common among adolescent girls and young women,
especially if anaemic, but among adults rarer in women than in men, becoming
more frequent in both sexes with old age; the phlegmatic are more
liable to it than the sanguine or the nervous.</p></div>

thought I was about to have an attack, and resisted with all my strength,
and it failed to take place. But I found myself in a strange psychic state.
On leaving the theatre I seemed to be dreaming. I saw and heard
everything and talked as usual. But everything seemed strange. Nothing
seemed to reach directly <em>me</em> or to be a real impression, but merely
the automatic reproduction of something learnt, only I felt that I had
lived it all before and felt it; at that moment I simply seemed to be

of my first paper on the subject: 'I find, as you foretold, that it
is difficult to recall an experience of this kind in all its details. I feel sure,
however, that it is not necessarily allied with an enfeebled or overwrought
nervous system. It was commonest with me in my youth, at a time when
my life was a pleasant one, and my brain not fagged as now. I still
[aged 43] have it occasionally, but not so frequently as twenty years ago.'
It may be added that my friend, of Highland family, was a man of keen
and emotional nervous temperament, a strenuous mental worker&mdash;whence
at one time a serious breakdown in health&mdash;and had published two volumes
of poems in early life. The greater liability to paramnesia in early life,
which is generally recognised, is comparable to the special liability of
children to hypnagogic visions, both phenomena being probably due to
the greater excitability and easier exhaustibility of the youthful brain.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_235_235" id="Footnote_235_235"></a><a href="#FNanchor_235_235"><span class="label">[235]</span></a> The explanation of paramnesia here set forth received on its first
publication the approval of L&eacute;on Marillier, who considered it 'ingenious
and seductive,' and as adequately accounting for the phenomena, provided
we bear in mind that the loss of a clear feeling of time is characteristic of
hypnagogic and allied states, the perception of each moment being immediately
transferred into an ancient memory, and consequently recognised
(<cite>L'Ann&eacute;e Biologique</cite>, third year, 1897, p. 772). This necessity for
taking into account the co-existence of perception and illusory remembrance
has largely moulded several of the theories of paramnesia. Thus
Jean de Pury (<cite>Archives de Psychologie</cite>, December 1902), while affirming
that pseudo-reminiscence is due to an <em>anteriorisation</em> of actual perceptions,
regards it as of the nature of a double refraction such as that simultaneously
produced on two faces of a prism by the same image; under the influence
of conditions he is unable to define, an image appears for the moment
on the plane both of the past and of the present, and psychically we see
double just as physically we see double when the parallelism of our visual
rays is disturbed. Pi&eacute;ron, again, taking up a theory at one time favoured
by Dugas, and previously suggested in one form or another by Ribot and
Fouill&eacute;e, assumes the formation of two images: one which, owing to
distraction or fatigue, reaches consciousness after having traversed subconsciousness,
and so takes on a dream-like and effaced character, and
almost simultaneously with this a direct perception which has not thus
changed its character; the shock of the conflict between these two produces
the pseudo-reminiscence ('Sur l'Interpretation des Faits de Paramn&eacute;sie,'
<cite>Revue Philosophique</cite>, August 1902). Alb&egrave;s, in his Paris thesis,
criticises this explanation, pointing out that a sequence of this kind very
frequently occurs, but produces no pseudo-reminiscence.</p></div>

known to me through brief summaries)&mdash;according to which the pseudo-reminiscence

a sensation which is thus degraded to the level of a reproduced impression&mdash;seems

by some peculiar disposition of the neurons. Such explanations are as
much outside the psychologist's sphere as the old-fashioned explanations
by reference to God and the Devil. A known physiological or pathological
process may, indeed, quite properly be recognised by the psychologist;
such, for instance, as the disturbance of the heart associated with
some dreams. Even minute changes in the brain, when they have been
properly determined by the histologist, may be effectively invoked by the
psychologist if they seem to supply an exact physical correlative to his
own findings. But for the psychologist to go outside his own field, and
invent a purely fanciful and arbitrary neuronic scheme to suit a psychic
process, explains nothing. It is merely child's play. The stuff that the
psychologist works with must be psychical, just as the stuff of the physicist's
work must be physical.</p></div>

dreaming. This is obviously the case as regards day-dreaming or reverie.
(See <em>e.g.</em> Janet, <cite>N&eacute;vroses et Id&eacute;es Fixes</cite>, vol. i. pp. 390-6.) It would also
appear that wit is the result of a process analogous to that fusion of incompatible
elements which we have found to prevail in dreams. Our
dreams are sometimes full of usually ineffective wit; I could easily quote
dreams in illustration. (Freud has, from his point of view, studied the
analogy between wit and dreaming in <cite>Der Witz und seine Beziehung zum

She instinctively began to write at the age of twelve, and it was by completing
her dreams that she became a novelist (Chabaneix, <cite>Le Subconscient</cite>,
p. 49). George Sand's early day-dreams, of which she gives so
interesting an account (<cite>Histoire de ma Vie</cite>, part III. ch. viii), developed
around the central figure of Coramb&eacute;, first seen in a real dream.
Coramb&eacute; was, at the same time, a divine being, to whom she erected an

was chiefly concerned with the exploration of the religious myths, he
pointed out that epics and fairy-tales (Amor and Psyche, the stories of the
Nibelung and Baldur, etc.) may be similarly explained. It seems probable
that his investigations received a stimulus in the earlier experiments
of J. Boerner (<cite>Das Alpdr&uuml;cken</cite>, 1855) on the production of nightmare.
Laistner has had many followers, notable C. Ruths (<cite>Experimental-Untersuchungen
&uuml;ber Musikphantome</cite>, 1898), who argues (pp. 415-46) that the
old Greek myths had their chief root in dream phenomena, in delirium,
and in the visions aroused in some persons by hearing music, while he
considers that many fabulous monsters and dragons have arisen from the
combinations seen in dreams. We know that the Greeks, who were such
great myth-makers, much occupied themselves in lying in wait for dreams,
and in oneiromancy and necromancy (<em>e.g.</em>, Bouch&eacute;-Leclercq, <cite>Histoire de la
Divination dans l'Antiquit&eacute;</cite>, vol. 1. Bk. ii. ch. i. pp. 277-329). In this way
alone it is doubtless true that, as Jewell says, 'dreams have had a great
effect upon the history of the world.'</p></div>

spontaneous visual phenomena with Heaven. 'When I gets to bed,' said
an aged and superannuated dustman to Vanderkiste (<cite>The Dens of London</cite>,
p. 14), 'I says my prayers, and I puts my hands afore my eyes&mdash;so [covering
his face with his hands]; well, I sees such beautiful things, sparkles
like, all afloating about, and I wished to ax yer, sir, if that ain't a something
of Heaven, sir.'</p></div>

was accustomed to look at her watch on awaking in the morning, and, if

<p><a name="Footnote_262_262" id="Footnote_262_262"></a><a href="#FNanchor_262_262"><span class="label">[262]</span></a> Synesius refers to conversations with sheep in dreams, and he was
probably the first to suggest that such dream phenomena may be the
origin of fables in which animals speak. The dog and the cat, as we
should expect, seem most frequently to speak in the dreams of civilised
people. Thus I dreamed that I had a conversation with a cat who spoke
with fair clearness and sense, though the whole of her sentences were not
intelligible. I was not surprised at this relative lack of intelligibility, but
neither was I surprised at her speaking at all. I have also encountered
a talking parrot whose speech was more relevant than that of most talking
parrots; this somewhat surprised me. In legends a wider range of
animals are able to speak, no doubt because the primitive legend-makers
were familiar with a wider range of animal life. How natural it is to the
uninstructed mind to treat animals like human beings is well shown by
the experiences of Helen Keller, the blind deaf-mute, who writes (<cite>The
World I Live in</cite>, p. 147): 'After my education began, the world which
came within my reach was all alive.... It was two years before I could
be made to believe that my dogs did not understand what I said, and I
always apologised to them when I ran into or stepped on them.'</p></div>

independent of that act of the judgment or understanding by which we
affirm or deny the existence of a reality correspondent to them. Such is
the ordinary state of the mind in dreams.... Add to this a voluntary
lending of the will to this suspension of one of its own operations, and
you have the true theory of stage illusion.'</p></div>

the benefit which he had gained by gazing at clouds or at mud-bespattered
walls; and recommended the practice to other artists, for
thereby, he says, they will receive suggestions for landscapes, battlepieces,
'and infinite things,' which they may bring to perfection. He
compared this to the possibility of hearing words in the sounds of bells.
Some other distinguished artists have adopted somewhat similar practices
which are fundamentally the child's habit of seeing pictures in the fire.</p></div>

boyhood to a kind of waking trance. 'This has generally come upon
me,' he wrote, 'through repeating my own name two or three times to
myself silently.' (It thus seems to have been a sort of auto-hypnotisation.)
In this state, individuality seemed to dissolve, he said, and he found in
it a proof that the extinction of personality by death would not involve loss
of life, but rather a fuller life. We are so easily convinced in these matters!</p></div>

still survives&mdash;at the age of twenty-one. In old age he told Lalande
the astronomer (as the latter relates in his <cite>Voyage d'un Fran&ccedil;ais en
Italie</cite>, 1765, vol. ix. p. 55) that he had had a dream in which he sold his
soul to the Devil, and it occurred to him in his dream to hand his fiddle
to the Devil to see what he could do with it. 'But how great was
my astonishment when I heard him play with consummate skill a
sonata of such exquisite beauty as surpassed the boldest flights of my
imagination. I felt enraptured, transported, enchanted; my breath
was taken away, and I awoke. Seizing my violin I tried to retain the
sounds I had heard. But it was in vain. The piece I then composed,
the "Devil's Sonata," was the best I ever wrote, but how far below the one
I had heard in my dream!' The dream, it will be seen, was of a fairly
common type, and to Tartini's excitable temperament it served as a
stimulus to his finest energies. But the real 'Devil's Sonata' was hopelessly
lost. (See the articles on Tartini in Fetis, <cite>Biographic Universelle
des Musiciens</cite>, and Grove's <cite>Dictionary of Music and Musicians</cite>.)</p></div>

chapters on her dreams in <cite>The World I Live in</cite>. For the most part it
would seem that the dream life of the blind (which has been studied
by, among others, Jastrow, <cite>Fact and Fable in Psychology</cite>, pp. 337 <em>et seq.</em>)
is not usually rich or vivid.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_275_275" id="Footnote_275_275"></a><a href="#FNanchor_275_275"><span class="label">[275]</span></a> This aspect of dreaming has been set forth by Bergson (<cite>Revue Philosophique</cite>,
December 1908, p. 574). 'The dream state,' he remarks, 'is
the substratum of our normal state. Nothing is added in waking life; on
the contrary, waking life is obtained by the limitation, concentration, and
tension of that diffuse psychological life which is the life of dreaming.
The perception and the memory which we find in dreaming are, in a sense,
more natural than those of waking life: consciousness is then amused
in perceiving for the sake of perceiving, and in remembering for the sake
of remembering, without care for life, that is to say for the accomplishment
of actions. To be awake is to eliminate, to choose, to concentrate the
totality of the diffused life of dreaming to a point, to a practical problem.
To be awake is to will; cease to will, detach yourself from life, become
disinterested: in so doing you pass from the waking ego to the dreaming
ego, which is less <em>tense</em>, but more <em>extended</em> than the other.'</p></div>

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
